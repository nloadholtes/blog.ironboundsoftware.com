After a converation at work about the flipping of a coin (and is it really a 50-50 chance of heads or tails), I came across this [article](http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20040228/fob2.asp) today. Its seems that there some catches to the statement I made yesterday.   
  
Research has found that there does seem to be a bias when flipping a coin, it seem that a coin is more likely to land on the same face it started out on. So if its heads up when you flip it, it is more likely that it will be heads up when it lands. I'll be sure to remember that next time someone asks if I want to flip for something...
