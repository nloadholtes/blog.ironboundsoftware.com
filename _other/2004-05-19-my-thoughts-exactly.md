I try not to get into wars over why one technology is better than the other, but I have to point out two links that made me laugh out loud when I read them. [Robert Alsina's](http://www.pycs.net/lateral/weblog/2004/05/18.html) comments about perl programmers, and [JWZ's](http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz/312657.html) thoughts on people who spend too much time in database land.   
  
    
They both hit the nail on the head with their respective topics. Additionally, they made me think about how I use software tools (i.e. python versus perl, oracle vs SQLServer). It is important to remember to use the right tool for the right job. The other day I was trying like mad to figure out a way to use python to parse out [a html page](http://www.nfl.com/stats) so that I could take the data and shove it into a database. But after stopping and thinking about it for a while I decided that it will probably be better to get the stats some other way (like getting a CD from one of the stat websites). If nothing else, trying to design a DB schema to store that stuff will take me just shy of forever, and the draft for my fantasy football league isn't that far away....   
  
    
But I do think that I'll be using python to access and mutilate manipulate the data that I get out of the DB... ;)
