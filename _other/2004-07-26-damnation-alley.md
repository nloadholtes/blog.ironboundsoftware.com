When it comes to video games (specifically PC games) I'm a big fan of _[Wasteland](http://www.wastelandranger.org)_ and the _Fallout_ series of games. I really dig the post-apocalyptic theme of these games. For me they are much more fun than the typical RPG fare of magic and dragons and such.   
  
    
How ever, there seems to be a shortage of these types of games, and for that matter movies and books. But a few months ago I saw a movie called [Damnation Alley](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075909/). Its from 1977 and stars Jan Michael-Vincent (from AirWolf) and George Peppard (from the A-Team). Its a little on the campy side, but I really enjoyed it. It was like Wasteland was made into a movie. I'm going to have to go do some research and see if the game was inspired by the movie.   
  
    
The movie was based off of a Roger Zelanzy book of the same name. I just started reading the book yesterday so I'm only 10 pages into so far. From what I've read in the reviews, its supposed to be pretty good. I'm hoping that it will inspire me to write the post-apocalyptic RPG that I know I can write. ;)   
  
    
And speaking of which, I'm looking at the [Nothack](http://www.pygame.org/ludumcontest1.shtml) source code by Roger 'Denor' Ostrander as an inspiration for a top down 2d RPG. Written in Python, I think it is a very good starting point. I'm slowly learning to take other people's code and use it for a starting point as opposed to writing everything from scratch. :) Python never ceses to amaze me, the code seems pretty easy to grasp. I tried writing something like this in Java a while back and it just seemed to spiral out of control. But then again I do remember I was trying to architect something big with it, so that's probably why the java code looks so ugh today.
