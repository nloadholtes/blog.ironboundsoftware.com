Lately I've been doing some refactoring in Java using Eclipse. I have to say it really made things easier (propagating changes through the whole codebase, etc.).   
  
    
In my spare time I've been plugging away at the nothack code. It makes me wish there were refactoring tools for python. Or rather, refactoring tools like there is for Java, but for python.
