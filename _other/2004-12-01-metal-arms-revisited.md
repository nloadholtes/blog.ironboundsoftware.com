A while [back](http://www.pycs.net/users/0000316/2004/8/28/) I was talking about how much _Metal Arms: Glitch in the system_ was getting on my nerves (there was a jump in the beginning that I was having problems with). Well, I would just like to take a moment to say that the game has made up for that misstep in the beginning.  
  
    
I'm really digging the game now. Once I got past the training mission of the game I managed to discover a true gem of a game. Cursing robots, interesting puzzles, neat gameplay (by hijacking enemy robots), and cool flashy graphics. All of these combined together in the perfect blend that screams out fun. At least to me. You mileage may vary.  
  
    
I for one am quite happy and getting good mileage from it. Everywhere I've seen it for sale has had it for $19.99 or so. I think this is a steal for a game of this length and quality. I really hope there is a sequel. A ***good*** sequel.  
  
    
Oh, and by the way, the AI isn't anything special in this game, I know that will turn off some people. But for someone who doesn't want to constantly get horse whipped by the computer, this is a good thing. The enemies in the game are smart, but if you can hit them before they see you (or knock out several at once) then you have a pretty good chance of taking them out.
