Recently in his blog [JWZ](http://jwz.livejournal.com/424854.html) posted about the FSF's promotion of getting 3 people to sign up and as a reward/incentive they will have with Richard Stallman (aka RMS) or Eben Moglen record personalized greeting on your answering machine.  
  
    
Now keeping in mind that JWZ is the man behind [XEmacs](http://www.xemacs.org) which is a fork of Emacs which Stallman wrote, and that this posting was on JWZ's site, there was a lot of funny comments about the answering machine message and Stallman in general.  
  
    
But one response that cracked me up was this [one](http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz/424854.html?thread=5308566#t5308566) where the write describes going to lunch with RMS and the hilarity that ensued. After reading it I thought to myself that the story sounded familiar. That's when I remembered reading [this story](http://www.hollan.org/rmsvisit.html) about a visit by RMS to a company to give a speech. It is amazing to read these stories, one written by a JWZ fan and the other by an RMS fan, about the same situation (leaving the tip on a lunch bill) and seeing each persons' take on the situation. One person thinks its witty, the other thinks its asinine.  
  
    
I wasn't sure about what I thought of that until I plugged in a search to [A9](http://a9.com) and saw (search for the word "tip") [this](http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch05.html). Having worked for tips in the past I'd be pissed if someone did that to me thinking it was funny.
