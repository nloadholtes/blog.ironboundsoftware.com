Most everyone probably already knows this, but I've just recently discovered [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html) is the coolest utility I have come across in a while. For those of you who don't know about it, its a unix util that is used to pull down files from web ot ftp sites.  
  
    
I recently used it to help me upload some files. I had a directory that was full of junk files (images that had been resized, backup files, etc.) and I didn't want to manually dig through it to figure out what to upload to the web server. Using wget I just changed directories to a temp dir, pointed wget at my work directory (specifically the index.html file I was working on) and specified the recurse option. About 10 seconds later it had copied only what was refrenced by the html files over to my temp dir. That was a big time and space saver, I had over 500megs of junk in the first directory, wget helped me whittle that down to the 11 megs that were necessary.
