I just finished updating my home system. Why can't I have an OS update/upgrade go smoothly? Personally I'm starting to think I'm cursed.  
  
    
This upgrade (from Mandrake 9.2 to 10.1) seemed to go smoothly but then as I played with the system I discovered that while it did upgrade everything, not everything is working. Example: The system keep looking for the floppy drive which was removed a while ago.  
  
    
Also, apparently the new version of [XEmacs](http://www.xemacs.org) is prett different from the older version I was using. As soon as I started it up it started screaming bloody murder about my custom.el, apparently there's a lot of crap in there that isn't working right now. Big surprise, I've been thinking for the last year or two that it needed to be overhauled. Looks like the time is now... ugh.
