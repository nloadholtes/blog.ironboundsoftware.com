Recently I found myself wanting to scrape a couple of web pages to get the content off of them. I did some searching and came across [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) which is a very handly HTML/XML parser. Very basic, yet did exactly what I needed it to. I highly recommend it if you want to do some HTML scraping with python. Soup is good!
