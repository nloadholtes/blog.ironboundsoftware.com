I've been doing a lot of reading here lately. When I was a kid I used to read a ton of books. But once I got into high school I really slowed down. By the time I got out of college, the only thing I seemed to read where programming related books. (aka nerd material)  
  
    
But in the last year or two I've really started to dive back into reading fiction. And so far I have to say I'm really enjoying it. Even the worst thing I've read in the last year or so is still better than 90% of what's on TV.  
  
    
I've been focusing on a lot of sci-fi and post-apocalyptic books. I'm hoping to draw inspiration from them in my quest to create a cool [game like Wasteland](http://wasteland.rockdud.net/wasteland.html). It dawned on me that I should write down my thoughts about these books as I read them so that way I can keep them straight. And I thought that since I'm writing a review of these books, why not publish them?  
  
    
So that's what I'm doing. My [wife](http://www.royalmoonbeads.com) and I are putting together a [site to review books (and other stuff). So if you are interested, please feel free to drop by ad check them out.
