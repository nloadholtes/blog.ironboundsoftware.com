Ok, I finally break down and try to join the Apple tribe and what do they do? Tear down the tent and leave town!. It figures as much though, I seem to have that kind of luck. But it doesn't mean my mac mini will stop working tomorrow. In fact for a while (like a year or two) there probably will be no difference in what I'm doing. So instead of bellyaching like everyone else about how the PowerPC Mac is fading into the sunset, I've decided to post my complaints about a lot of different companies/technologies. 

### -x86

Nice and accessible (cheap price, tons of documentation), but can we please move the architecture forward and leave behind 16-bit mode? I know legacy is important, but at some point we all have to leave the nest. (And thank you to AMD for making those first few steps.) 

###  -Sun, Solaris, sparc

For a long time I thought Sun was the be all end all when it came to unix. Then I started to realize that they (the company, the os, the chip) were not moving forward fast enough. Which is too bad, I like a lot of their products. Even if they are expensive to the point that Scrooge McDuck couldn't afford them. 

### -Microsoft

*sigh* So much potential, so little progress. Yes, Win95 was a step in the right direction, and I'm so glad that Win2000 was based on NT4 rather than Win98. But why did they let things like IE, Office bloat, and security holes get so out of control? I think they could have made a ton of money by Doing The Right Thing(tm). Look at Google. They are what Microsoft was and could have been. 

### -Motorola and IBM

Thank you for the PowerPC architecture. But why didn't it take over the PC market? Or maybe I'm asking this question too soon. IBM seems to have something up their sleeves. 

### -Linux

Why? Why, why, why, why? So close to breaking through to the mainstream, yet you don't. Why must you tease us? A clean, usable desktop, working sound, that's all we ask for. Apple and Microsoft can do that, it can't be that hard can it? Perhaps having no central authority tying all of these together is a bad thing. 

### -Apple

Thanks for switching hardware on me a month after I buy into the hype. I appreciate that. Way to keep me on my toes. But seriously, why? Sales are increasing, popularity is rising, you're set to take on the world. Now pull out the rug? Or are Mr. Cringely's predictions about Apple going to come true? I don't know, all I know is if I have to leave the mini within a year (because of a forced software upgrade) I'll be pissed.
