If you get a chance check out Steer Madness. Its a pretty creative little game. Its like Grand Theft Auto, but with a more socially redeeming message. I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, but I'm finding the game entertaining. There's something about a cow riding a bike on a half-pipe that amuses the hell out of me.... If nothing else it is inspiring me to get up and keep working on all of the little projects I've got piled up (the python RPG I keep talking about doing, the web apps that I think are neat/easy to do, etc. etc. etc.).
