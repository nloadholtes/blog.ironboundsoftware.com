Pointless Waste Of Time is a site that always cracks me up. Not only is the content there funny, but sometimes the consequences of the content are even funnier. For example, every few months someone will submit a story to Slashdot about a game related article on PWOT (usually about the next generation consoles, or game reviews, etc.). Without fail, about 95% of the people who post to /. seem to miss the point that the site is a humor/parody site and will thus take serious issue with what ever "joke" article was posted. And this is funny to me, its like I get a joke that no one else does. But today I really had to laugh. I like to read the articles at the Mathematical Association of America's website, and today there was one article about an interesting sounding game. But in the middle of the article while talking about the Artificial Intelligence in the game, the author quotes a PWOT article! True, the line he quotes (about A.I. in games) is a good one and is actually quite applicable. But still, it just makes me laugh. Tags:games,ai
