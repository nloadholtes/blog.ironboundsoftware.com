I can't believe I'm going to admit this, but I watched the Will Smith movie "Hitch" the other night and Mr. Smith said something that I thought was really memorable. Begin each day as if it were on purpose. That is a good nugget of wisdom. I'm putting that in this blog to serve as inspiration, with a solid thought like that, you can get a lot of things done.
