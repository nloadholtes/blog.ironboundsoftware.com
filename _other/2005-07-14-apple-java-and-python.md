Today on [Slashdot](http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/11/1833252&tid=108&tid=179&tid=3) I saw this article about how there is going to be a freeze of the Cocoa for Java API. A lot of people of course saw this the wrong way (that Apple is abandoning Java) instead of seeing this for what it is (Apple freezing the API because they don't want to support it in Cocoa anymore).  
  
It struck me as kind of funny, just yesterday I started reading the Apple Cocoa documentation and playing with the tutorial. I stopped and thought to myself "Should I try to do the Java version of Cocoa or just stick to the Objective-C?" It looks like I made the right choice by sticking to the Objective-C tutorial.  
  
At least until there's an offical Cocoa Python API. That would rock. I really want to use Python with OS X, but I'm leary of the PyObjC stuff. I would like to be able to distribute what I write without having it tied so strongly to my version of OS X. (For example, from reading the PyObjC site it looks like if I make something on 10.4, someone running 10.3 might not be able to run the program.) Apple seems to like Python (I've seen postings where people are calling for Python to replace AppleScript), hopefully there will be more support for it in the future (as in an Cocoa API).
