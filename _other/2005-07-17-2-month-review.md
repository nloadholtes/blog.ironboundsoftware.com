Well its been about two months since I got the Mac Mini and I have to say that I'm suprisingly happy with it. From everything I had read and heard about the hardware I thought I would like it, but I was unsure about the software, specifically OS X. I ws expecting it to be a lot like Linux, but that really is not the case. If anything, OS X is what Linus should aspire to be. Unified in its look and feel (even though some progams like iTunes still bug me), consistent in its implementation, this is what Linux and its apps should be like. And as a developer I'm very pleased with the quantity and quality of the development tools that come with the Mac. I was expecting to have to go invest in new tools, but for the most part everything you could want is already there in XCode. Good stuff. I think I'm going to be able to write up some great software using these tools. (Ok, I've alreay started writing software using these tools, lets hope it turns out great!) Perhaps the biggest sign that I really like the Mac platform is the fact I've been trying to convince people to get a Mac Mini. When did I become the Mac guy? I guess the quality of this platform speaks for itself. Tags: OS X, Reviews, Linux
