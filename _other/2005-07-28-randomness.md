The [MAA](http://maa.org) website is constant source of interesting bits of information. Today while reading Ivar's new column I saw a link to an older article called [Random Home Runs](http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_7_02_01.html) where he discusses the topic of "Do baseball hitters have streaks?". I highly recommend the article, its very enlightening.
