Its a great feeling when you accomplish something. Its even better when its a project you started, worked hard on, and then finished. Ever since I finished and posted my [PasswordMaker](http://ironboundsoftware.com/) widget I've been bursting with energy ready to take on the next programming task.  
  
Which got me thinking, I've been trying to utilize the "Getting Things Done" methodology for the last few months in an attempt to get more control over what's going on. Overall its working, but I haven't had any big break throughs until I finished this widget. I've got momentum now, and I'm going to try and steer it in the direction of making another widget this afternoon. Hopefully I'll be done quicker and have it [posted](http://ironboundsoftware.com) soon...
