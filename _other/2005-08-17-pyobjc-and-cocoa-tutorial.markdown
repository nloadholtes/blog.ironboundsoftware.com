A great article has been posted to the Apple Developer site. [The article](http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/pyobjc.html) is a tutorial for using [PyObjC](http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/) to write Cocoa applications for the Mac. This is exactly what I've been wanting to do, [Python](http://python.org) just rocks and I've been looking for a way to combine it with Mac programs. This tutorial explains how to use PyObjC with XCode. Why is this so important to me? I think this is important because I like to use Python as a prototyping language, and now I can not only prototype, I can code and deploy from one code base. **_That_** just rocks. This article is from [Jonathan 'Wolf' Rentzsch](http://rentzsch.com/). I highly recommend his site, its chock full of coding and Mac goodness. This announcement of this tutorial is [here](http://rentzsch.com/links/adcPyObjC). If you are a python or mac developer (or want to be both, like I do) I highly suggest you run, do not walk, to the tutorial and start learnin'!
