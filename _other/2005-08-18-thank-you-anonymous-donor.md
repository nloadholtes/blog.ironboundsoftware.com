Someone left a present for me in the [Tip Jar](http://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/pay/T3N00S8HZI0ND2)! Thank you so very much who every you are! (The Amazon sites doesn't show me who it was, just a transaction number.) I'm really excited, this is such a big boost for my morale. I mean simply getting the [Password Maker widget](http://ironboundsoftware.com/passwordmaker.html) done and out the door was a big thing, but now that someone has liked it enough to donate to the cause, that has kicked me into orbit. I was feeling pretty motivated before, so watch out now, I'm gonna be coding up a storm this weekend! And as a side note, my next widget is almost done and I'm hoping to have it published this weekend. Keep checking back here for the latest news!
