One of the things I like the best about the internet is that it allows anyone to have a voice (although, sometimes that is the worst part about the internet too). And one group of people that I think need a voice bad are the independent artists. There's a lot that's wrong with the music business (and the other entertainment businesses for that matter). The internet not only allows us to voice what is wrong but to also offer up an alternative. [Kristin Hersh](http://www.throwingmusic.com/) is a great singer-songwriter who is using the internet to do her thing. Check out her newly re-designed website [here](http://www.throwingmusic.com/) and be sure to check out her [thoughts](http://www.throwingmusic.com/press/2005fmpr.html) about the music industry. Also check out her [free music](http://www.throwingmusic.com/freemusic/)! I've been listening to her for a few years (she was in **Throwing Muses** , **50ft Wave** , and has several great solo albums), and I highly recommend her stuff. It good!
