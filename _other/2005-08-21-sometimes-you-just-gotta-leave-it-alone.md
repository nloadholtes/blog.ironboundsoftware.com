This paragraph is so full of so many truths its not even funny. From [CNN.com - Keeping enemies close at the Google Dance - Aug 20, 2005](http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/internet/08/20/google.dance.ap/index.html)

> The efforts to outsmart Google gall some webmasters such as Shari Thurow, who says the best way to increase a site's search engine ranking is to offer valuable content and products. She describes the Black Hats as "pathetic algoholics" because they are so obsessed with trying to figure out Google's algorithms.

And I have to laugh because I caught myself thinking the other day, "I should post more about _topic xyz_ because that seems to make the visits to the page spike...". That was when I had to step back and remind myself its about the quality of your content, not the quantity. Especially if you want to try and exploit any useful connections (i.e. the tags).
