My definition of multitasking: _The ability to perform many tasks **poorly** at the same time._ Everyone wants us to multitask. **_We_** want to multitask in order to get more things done. However, since you are not concentrating on any single thing, you wind up not doing as good of a job as you wanted to on not just one, but several tasks. This happened to me this weekend. It was a swift kick to the morale and as a result I wound up not doing anything productive. That's a bad cycle to get stuck in. Small related and grouped tasks lead to finished tasks. And finished tasks means you got something done, which means you took care of business.
