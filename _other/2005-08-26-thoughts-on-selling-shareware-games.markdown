I've always thought it would be cool and fun to write and sell shareware games. After a while I decided that I need to not think about "selling" and instead focus on "writing" because without fail, when I spent more time thinking about the selling I spent less time creating. It doesn't matter how much money you think you can/will make, if you don't have a product! Nowadays I find I'm headed in the other direction, I've actually got a [ product](http://ironboundsoftware.com/passwordmaker.html), now I'm thinking about trying to make a small buisness out of it. [Jack ](http://www.winterwolves.net/blog/2005/08/giving-up-even-before-trying.html) of [Winterwolves](http://www.winterwolves.com/) has some thoughts on this topic. This [post](http://www.winterwolves.net/blog/2005/03/indie-developers-wannabe.html) is also worth a read, I think he really hits on some good points about doing the whole shareware game thing as an indie developer.
