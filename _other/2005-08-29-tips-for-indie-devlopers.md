The other day I came across an article that had some really great advice about developing "indie" software. I think these tips are great and can apply to any situation in life, not just in programming. You should read the [article](http://www.macgamesandmore.com/macdevelopers.html) yourself, its a quick read. (note that its on the right side of the page under the Google ads.) Here's the major points: 
* **Don't waste time**
* **Don't be evil**
* **Don't be naive**
* **Don't be a follower**
Good advice, and I think these are also the secrets to being sucessful.
