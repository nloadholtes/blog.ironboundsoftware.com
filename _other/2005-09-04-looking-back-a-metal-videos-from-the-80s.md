Thanks to [VH1.com](http://www.vh1.com/) and [TiVo](http://tivo.com) I've been catching a lot of classic metal video's from back in the day. When I was a kid, [Dokken](http://www.dokken.net/index2.html) was my favorite band (yes, I can admit that!). I had all their tapes and loved the music. But it wasn't until right before the first breakup of the band that I finally saw a video from them. I just thought that they just didn't "do" videos (kinda like Metallica before "One"). Then on one of those flashback shows I saw [Jeff Pilson](http://www.jeffpilson.com/) (the bassist) groaning about how bad their videos were. He wasn't kidding. Thanks to the Vh1 Classic show "Metal Mania" that Tivo keeps recording for me I have now been able to witness several Dokken videos. I'm really glad I didn't see these back in the day, I probably would have stopped listening to the group. Not all of their videos were that bad, but there were some that were pretty cheesy. But then again, cheesy is a realtive term. Kiss made some really, _really_ , _**really**_ cheesy videos. Everytime I see one of their videos from the 80's I have to tell myself "They are a good band. Just go listen to their greatest hits. Looks and sound are two different things...". And of course Kiss is not alone in sounding better than they looked (in videos), others that leap to mind are Twisted Sister, Ratt, and Poison.... among others. I guess it just goes to show you that its the music that matters, not the image. When I listen to the music today it still rocks. When I watch the videos... well, they look a bit dated (i.e. goofy).
