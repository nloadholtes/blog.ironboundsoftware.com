I'm sure that everyone and their uncle already knows this, but I thought it needed to be said out loud. [Ratchet & Clank](http://www.ratchetandclankgadgets.com/#) is a pretty fun game! I picked up "Up Your Arsenal" the other day and have been playing it ever since. Its funny, and chock full of action. It reminds me a lot of _Metal Arms: Glitch in the system_ , but with a better start (It took me about a mission or two to get into Metal Arms, Ratch and Clank hit the ground running.) I got it for a steal at the game shop used, so go check it out if you haven't already!
