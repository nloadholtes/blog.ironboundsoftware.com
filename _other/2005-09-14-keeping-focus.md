My plan to disconnect from the internet at work in order to focus (And therefore be more productive) has hit a snag. Or rather, my lack of a plan has hit a snag. I did not have a plan concerning what I would focus on. As a result, I had no direction in which to focus my energies. And if you don't have a direction... you go no where. This all goes back to the GTD principle of the To Do list. Before attempting to focus, one needs to make sure there is something to focus on (i.e. have items on your To Do list that you can act on).
