In an earlier [post](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2005/09/04/looking-back-a-metal-videos-from-the-80s/) I was commenting on Dokken's videos. Well the magic of TiVo did its thing again and recorded another hour of "Metal Mania" on VH1 Classics, and this time it picked up the video for "Dream Warriors" by Dokken from the _Nightmare on Elm Street 3_ soundtrack. While a little bit cheesy, this video was really fun and funny. Basically there were scenes from the movie, but instead of Freddy jumping out, it was members of the band (George popping out of a wall to deliver a guitar solo, Mick appearing in a furnace, etc.). The climax of the video where the band "interrupts" Freddy before he can start slicing and dicing was classic. But the best part was then ending when Freddy wakes up from a nightmare holding a stuffed animal saying, "What a nightmare! Who were those guys?" Too funny! So I will be bold and say that Dokken had one great video. It was certainly better than the other videos in that episode like the ones from Dio, Y&T;, and Iron Maiden (it was an old old old old Maiden video). Rockin' with Dokken, awww yeah!
