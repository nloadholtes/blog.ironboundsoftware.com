I agree with [Ned's thoughts](http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/200509.html#e20050916T074601) about [Google's](http://blogsearch.google.com) new blog search feature. Its good, but it doesn't seem to capture the essence of the blogs the way that [Technorati](http://technorati.com/) and other "Blog Search engines" do. The use of tags is what makes the blog engines so interesting. By explicitly stating what metadata the blog/post is associated with goes a long way in helping to categorize and organize the information contained in the blog. If there was a way to standardize how to identify the tagging metadata, it would be a huge step forward (assuming you could get everyone to join in and use them). It will be very interesting to see how this problem is solved.
