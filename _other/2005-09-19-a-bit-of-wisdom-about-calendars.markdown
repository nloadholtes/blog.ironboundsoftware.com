It doesn't matter how nice your calendar is, if its on your computer and networked to your phone/email/contacts/dog/tv/etc, or if its tacked to your wall, or if its a pocket-sized one that you carry with you everywhere. They all have the same shortcoming: **If you do not update it, it does you no good.** And along those lines, if you never look at it (which implies you never update it) it does absolutely no good. A calendar exists to keep us informed about things that are happening. It can not do its job if you do not keep it up to date with important and current information. Can you tell I just found out that I forgot to put something on my calendar that was somewhat important?
