[This](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9439555/) is a pretty cool article that talks about how weather forcasters try to predict were a hurricane will go and how hard it will hit. It talks about why the graphs you see on TV look the way they do (they are based on the probability models the computer generates based on current conditions and past storms). Good to know information so that you can "read" the maps they show on TV.
