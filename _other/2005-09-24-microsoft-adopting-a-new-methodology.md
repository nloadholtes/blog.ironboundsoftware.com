I'm not a huge fan of [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com), particularly of the way they are always releasing bug ridden code to the public while announcing it like its the greatest thing ever. But according to this article: [Battling Google, Microsoft Changes How It Builds Software](http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB112743680328349448,00.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) it sounds like things might be changing for the better over in Redmond. I find this article inspiring in that it shows that even if you have a huge code base fully of legacy code, thoughts, and idea, you can make a change for the better. It will be interesting to see what Vista is like when it hits the streets.
