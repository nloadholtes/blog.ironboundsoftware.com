The other day I discovered that one of the old blogs I used to have doesn't seem to be on line any more. I found some backups on my system and I was able to import them into this blog. You can get to them by clicking on the links under "Archives" on the right side. Also, most of them seem to be from 2004, so here's a [quick link](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2004/) to them. Enjoy!
