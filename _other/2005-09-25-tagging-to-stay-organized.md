Using tags to classify blog posts is a great idea. I think its more flexible that just having "folders" that you put a message into like you would with a mail program. Sometimes a message/blogpost/etc doesn't it nicely into one category, instead it spans several. With tags you can then mark the post with several different tags (one for each idea the post touches on). This makes searching so much easier because the message will be in each category, so you don't have to worry about missing it because you didn't guess the right "folder" to look in. That's just such a rich idea to me. Plus it can help build contextual information for search engines which will help people find the correct information they are looking for with less effort. That just rocks. I've got a ton of categories on this site, and I've tried to make sure that all of my posts are tagged correctly. My hope is that once I get a couple of hundred posts I'll be able to look at the tags and build a [graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) of the site. I think that will tell me some interesting things.
