Inspiration is a powerful motivator. In a lot of ways, inspiration is the opposite of [fear](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2005/09/20/focus-and-motivation-are-not-the-same-thing/). Yet the more you try to be inspired, the less inspired you get. In a lot of ways, it the chicken-and-the-egg problem (as in which one came first). If you are in the right environment, inspiration will find you. And when ti does the motivation to get started is not too far behind. I almost said "follow through" instead of "get started" because I think inspiration launches a lot of projects, but its motivation and perseverance that actually gets you to the finish line. But the question remains, where does inspiration come from? Where were you last inspired?
