This article begins to cover the many reasons why I feel [The Amazing Race](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race8/) is going downhill. [â€˜Amazing Raceâ€™ has lost its way - REALITY TV - MSNBC.com](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9493274/) It used to be a pretty good show, but now it seems to be pandering to a very low denominator, and that is sad. Its like they (the producers and the network) are saying "Hey, we need big ratings for this show, what can we do to clone our other shows to make this one just like them." Its like original ideas are forbidden in Hollywood.
