I was looking at the stats for this site the other day and it hit me: almost no one got here from [A9](http://a9.com). that stuck me as odd because I really like [A9](http://a9.com) (its a search engine from Amazon that uses Google's technology, but they have put their own spin on it). I did some digging and I saw that [A9](http://a9.com) doesn't rank real high on the search engine ueage rankings. That makes me sad. I really like [A9](http://a9.com). It has a good UI, its always fast, and being able to search for web pages and pictures at the same time just ricks. Plus not to mention you get a small discount on Amazon for using A9. And since its powered by Google, you're getting almost the same results. What's not to like? So go check it out! [A9 rocks](http://a9.com)!
