This is kinda cool, they have found a moon orbiting large Trans-Neptunian Object that was announced a few weeks ago: [The moon of the 10th planet](http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/moon/index.html). You know, the one called Xena. In fact, they are calling the moon Gabrielle. Once they are able to get some telescope time they are going to try and determine the orbital period which will give a pretty good mass estimate for the planet. Yes, I said planet, it sure seems like it is one crazy orbit or not.
