Recently I've had a lot of unexpected things crop up that were out of my control and it was interesting to see my whole "Getting Things Done" fall apart. First I had to let a few things slip because more important tasks came up. Then it became difficult to get the old tasks done (mostly school work) because they had a firm due date which had been moved up from what it had been originally. Needless to say, this caused a lot of stress for me, which I noticed in turn caused me to be less productive (tasks took longer to finish, etc.). Now that things have calmed down a bit it has re-ignited my desire to get my to do lists back in order. When things were going smooth I had forgotten about the chaos that had reigned freely before. I had also forgotten how stressful life could be without a plan. Even though you can't plan around emergencies, I've learned that having your to do lists done as soon as you can will save you a lot of grief down the road. So, find your motivation, make your to do lists/plans, and follow through on them as swiftly as you can. Its better to have free time than to having to be up all night trying to finish something at the last minute.
