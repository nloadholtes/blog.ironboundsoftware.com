Is anybody out there using the [Komodo](http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/?bc=1) IDE on a Mac? If so have you seen any weird problems? I ran into one right away and even though I can't find a [bug report](http://bugs.activestate.com/Komodo) that matches my problem, I don't want to file one until I'm absolutely sure its not just me. I'm really anxious to try out Komodo. I gave it a spin a year or two ago while looking for a python IDE. I wound up going with [Wingware](http://wingware.com/) because Komodo seemed to have some issues at the time. I'm hoping that now everything has been smoothed out. I really like Xcode, but I also really like code completion (and Xcode doesn't seem to offer that for python).
