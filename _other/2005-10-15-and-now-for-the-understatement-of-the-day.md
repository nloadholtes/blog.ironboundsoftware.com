From this article on MSNBC:[Space crew weathers a scare during re-entry](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9697668/) When describing to reporters the **air leak** in his **space capsule** (for those of you who don't follow space much, that is a **very very very** **_bad_** thing to have happen) Cosmonaut Sergey Krikalev said: 

> â€œIn principle this was an anomalous situation of medium complexity. ... In fact, it was a fairly serious situation.â€ 

Yikes, in my book any time air is leaking out of my sapceship while it is in space and I am sitting it it, it is an extremely serious situation.
