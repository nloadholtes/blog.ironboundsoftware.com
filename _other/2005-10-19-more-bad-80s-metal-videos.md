I've [mentioned](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2005/09/16/a-good-metal-video-from-the-80s/) it [before](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2005/09/04/looking-back-a-metal-videos-from-the-80s/), and once again TiVo delivered the goods. Another episode of Metal Mania and another Dokken video. This time it was "Breaking the chains" and whoa, it was something else. When I saw that interview with [Jeff Pilson](http://www.jeffpilson.com/) and he made that comment about cheesey videos, he must have been talking about this one. It was dripping with 80's cheese. But Jeff shouldn't feel too bad, I also saw a video from [Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_\(band\)) and Dio's [Holy Diver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Diver). Holy crap, that was cheesey. But hey, metal video are supposed to be cheesey. And that's what makes them _so_ metal.
