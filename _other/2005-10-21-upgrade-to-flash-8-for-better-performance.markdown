Everytime I hit a page with one of those annoying Flash ads telling me about mortgage rates, my Mac ginds to a halt. The CPU meter spikes to 100% and the browser's reponse gets sluggish. I finally got fed up with that and today I went to check my versions and see if there was a new update. Lo-and-behold, I was on 7.x and there is now version 8. After upgrading my CPU still goes busy, but it isn't hitting 100% and the browser is still usable. I highly recommend upgrading if you are anything earlier than 8. Go get it [here](http://flash.com)! By the way the browser I was talking about is [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/) (which is basically [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/)), but I've seen this problem in other browsers too.
