Over on [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/) there's an article talking about the life of an indie software developer. The article is geared towards the Mac side of things, but I think its a good read for all developers. Check it out: [Daring Fireball: The Life](http://daringfireball.net/2005/10/the_life) There's some really good points in there about what your expectations should be if you decide to be become a indie developer. I had already thought about the monetary aspects of it (how not every program sells 10 million copies) and that might mean that your endeavor will be a side job not your main job. But I had never considered the support side of the equation. Good software is not enough, you need a caring support team to shepard the software through its lifecycle. If you are the only person on this "support team" that means you are going to be busy or you are not going to be slinging code. That was (and still is) quite a revelation for me. You never really think of "success" as having a downside, but in this case, if you want to spend all of your time coding, then this is a serious drawback. Personally I don't mind supporting my users, but what if I had _thousands_ of users? That is a lot of potential support.
