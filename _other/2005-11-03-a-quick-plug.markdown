I've been reading a ton of books lately and I decided I would start reviewing them in case anyone wonders what I think (or what I've been reading lately). Check it out: [Katie And Nick's Reviews](http://katieandnickreviews.blogspot.com/) I'm pretty much going to review anything I can think of like [music](http://katieandnickreviews.blogspot.com/2005/11/made-in-china-juliana-hatfield.html), [books](http://katieandnickreviews.blogspot.com/2005/11/crunching-data.html), and [movies](http://katieandnickreviews.blogspot.com/2005/03/review-postman.html). Drop on by and [take a look](http://katieandnickreviews.blogspot.com/)!
