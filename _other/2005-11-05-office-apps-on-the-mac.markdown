The [Drunken Blog](http://www.drunkenblog.com/) is always a good place to catch up on news. ther other day while reading the site I saw this article: [The dirge of NeoOffice](http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000706.html). I've been trying to use [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) on my Mac for the last few weeks (specifically to do spreadsheet work) and it has been just downright painful. Apparently my transition to the "Mac Side" is complete, the thought of cranking up the X11 package makes my skin crawl. I was thinking that [NeoOffice](http://www.neooffice.org/) might be a solution to my Office needs and allow me to have the pride of using OpenOffice (which I do like on Linux and Windows). But after reading this article, it sounds like I might be better off getting the MS Office package for the Mac.
