Sometimes you need to stop and get your bearings. Today was one of those days for me. Having a To Do list (or several small ones in my case) doesn't do you any good if you are not moving towards an objective. That's the whole reason for the lists, to help you get things done. So make sure you have a clear goal in mind when you are making your To Do lists. The more focused on your goal your tasks are, the faster you will get there. Knocking out list items and making progress towards your goal can be addictive. Get started today!
