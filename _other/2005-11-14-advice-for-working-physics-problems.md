When working on physics problems (like homework problems in my case) there are a couple of things to remember: 

  1. Make sure the units match up. When you take an equation and plug all of the numbers in, take the time to go through and mark the units. Make sure that the end result is in the right format (i.e. m/s^2 not m/s).
  2. Most equations that use trig functions are expecting the angle measurement to be in radians, not degrees. Make sure your calculator is set to process radians (rads)! If you are evaluating the numbers as degrees when you enter in radians, you will get the wrong answer!

Hopefully I'll remember to follow these bits of advice. I know for a fact that my homework grade would be higher if I had my calculator set to rads!
