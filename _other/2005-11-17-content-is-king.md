I've been tyring out [BlogExplosion](http://www.blogexplosion.com/) lately. Its an interesting idea, you surf through various blogs gathering credits that are then used to circulate you site to other people using the system. The more you surf, the more people visit your site. I've seen a large spike in my traffic using the system. But its really a shotgun effect, throwing a ton of people at my site doesn't mean I'm going to get a lot of repeat visitors. For all I know, most people look at the site, decide they aren't interested in it and move on to the next site. The end results is yes, a lot of people visited the site, but not many people did anything while they were here. I've noticed that when people come to the site from a search engine, they tend to click on more pages. That is probably because they find the site more useful. And if a site is useful in terms of the content it provides, then there is a greater chance the visitor will click on the advertising (which is tied to the content). So if nothing else, this exercise of playing around with [BlogExplosion](http://www.blogexplosion.com/) has proven to me that content is king. Write about things that people are interested in, and they will find you.
