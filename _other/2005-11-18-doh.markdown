Lately google has been sending a lot of hits my way (for some reason I was the #5 refrence for sudoku strategy because of [this post](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2005/10/20/sudoku-strategy/)). A while ago I had written about getting better gas mileage (see [here](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2005/09/27/getting-better-gas-mileage-part-1/) and [here](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2005/09/28/getting-better-gas-mileage-part-2/)) but those pages are getting next to no hits, which struck me as odd seeing how gas is still fairly high these days. A closer look revealed that I misspelled "mileage" about 20 times. D'oh! If anyone was looking for "milage" tips, they probably would have been flooding onto this blog...
