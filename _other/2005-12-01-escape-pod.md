For the most part, Podcasts don't do a lot for me. That makes me feel kinda sad because I really like the idea of Podcasting, and I'm already listening to my iPod in the car, so it seems like a natural fit. I've only listened to about 4 or 5 podcasts, and with one exception they really haven't captured me like I thought they would. The exception is [The Escape Pod](http://escapepod.org/) which is a weekly sci-fi short story podcast. Most of the stories that are read are pretty good, and the host Steve Eley does a good job of presenting the show (and reading/performing the stories). If you are into sci-fi or even just good stories swing by and [check them out](http://escapepod.org/). I found the podcast through iTunes a while back and its the only podcast I still subscribe to. And after listening to several podcasts back to back, Steve's suggestion to blog about the Escape Pod finally worked. ;)
