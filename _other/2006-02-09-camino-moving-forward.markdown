As sort of a continuation of my musings about [Camino](http://caminobrowser.org) and Firefox, I've been doing some research into Camino, specifically into the "bugs" that bug me the most. It turns out things are not quite what they seem! While looking through the bug database I came across some answers: 
* **Rich Editing** \- On [GMail](http://mail.google.com) under Firefox there is an option to do "rich text editing". Under Camino, there is just the plain textarea. I thought this was a problem with Camino, but it turns out that its on Google's end. Apparently their site isn't "recognizing" Camino so it isn't sending the fancy rich text edit page. But according to this [bug report entry](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=291000#c15) that is getting ready to change. Soon GMail will offer rich text editing for Camino. Yaa! 
  

* **No Adsense plugin** \- I've grown addicted to Adsense in Firefox. In Camino it would be useful because it could cut down on the number of crazy flash and animated gifs that tend to spike the CPU to almost 100%. Alas there seems to be no plugin support for Camino. But while reading this [bug report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=288894#c10) I discovered that there is a "Block web advertising" option in the preferences (under "Web Features"). I checked that and viola! There are less ads on the screen now. Yippee! 
So that right there solves two of my biggest gripes! I had never thought to read through the bug reports of Camino before. I was looking at them today because I thought that perhaps instead of griping about things that aren't there/don't work, perhaps I should get in there and help out. I still think I will get the code and look around, its always good to have a project or two... Bottom line: Camino rocks. And it just keeps getting better.
