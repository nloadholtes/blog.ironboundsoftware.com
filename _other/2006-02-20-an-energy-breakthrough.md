There's a report that the president made a comment today about the energy situation that caught my eye ([CNN.com - Bush fuels case for alternative power - Feb 20, 2006](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/02/20/bush.energy.ap/index.html)): 

> "Our nation is on the threshold of new energy technology that I think will startle the American people," Bush said. "We're on the edge of some amazing breakthroughs -- breakthroughs all aimed at enhancing our national security and our economic security and the quality of life of the folks who live here in the United States." 

I hope this means something real, and not just some pipe dream. I wonder if there's going to be some interesting announcement in the near future. If there is, I wonder what it will be about (solar, [nuclear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_bed_reactor), oil, [table top fusion](http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Nuclear_Fusion_On_A_Tabletop.html), [zero-point energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_point_energy), etc.) Hopefully something real and attainable in a decent amount of time.
