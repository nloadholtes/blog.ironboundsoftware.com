If you were asking yourself, "I wonder what Nick has been doing for the last 2 hours?", I'll tell you. I'm been playing [Dumb: The Game](http://www.dumbthegame.com/index.php). Truthfully, I've only been playing the 5 sample puzzles. They are fun, but challenging. One or two Iwas able to figure out pretty quickly, but #9 and #12 have me stumped. Guess what I'm going to be thinking about for the rest of the day... [Mike](http://hamumu.com/index.php) is really on to something with this site, he's got a good idea for a game (brain teasers), he's got the perfect delivery medium (web pages so everyone can play), and he's got the perfect hook (funy name, good samples, free registration). Rock on [Hamumu](http://hamumu.com/index.php)!
