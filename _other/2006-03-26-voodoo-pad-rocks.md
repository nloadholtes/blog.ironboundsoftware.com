I'm probably behind the curve on this one, but I recently discovered in the last day or two how cool [Voodoo Pad](http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/) is. I've been using it to make to do lists (I'm trying to get back on the [Getting Things Done](http://www.davidco.com/) wagon). I'm really impressed how smoothly the program runs. It doesn't stand in the way of my data, it simply guides it and connects it auto-magically. That just amazes me, it makes me wish there was a port of this app for Windows so I can use it at work! So, if you are interested in [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtd) and are running on a [Mac](http://apple.com), go get [Voodoo Pad](http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/) and try it out. It rocks.
