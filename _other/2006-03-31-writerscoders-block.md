Writers block is always a pain because it usually strikes at the most inopportune time, like right before some thing is due. I've been pretty lucky over the years, I haven't run into it too many times. Closely related to writers block is Coders Block. Sadly I seem to be suffering from a full blown case of that. I've got things I could be doing, yet when I sit down to try and crank something out I just can't do it. Fortunately nothing is "due" so I'm not working against any deadline. But at the same time I can't seem to get the motivation to make something. Tomorrow is another day though, perhaps I will get my groove back then. My little stock market news analysis program needs to move forward, every day that I don't collect news is a day I don't gather any data. Its already been a few weeks since I started so I think I'm running out of excuses. Plus [Jerry](http://bertolami.com/jerry/) has been giving me all kinds of ideas in his comments, so I really need to get moving so I can keep up with his ideas. ;) Must...get....something....done.....
