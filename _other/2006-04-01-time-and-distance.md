After [my post yesterday](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2006/03/31/writerscoders-block/) I decided that today I would avoid the computer as much as possible. It looks like that was the right thing to do. Tonight I sat down and looked at some notes and it hit me: The reason I was stuck was because I didn't know what to do next. So, I began making lists. As soon as things started to appear in a nice neat ordered list, it became apparent what had to be done (and the order to do it in). A lot of programmers like to just jump into a problem and start coding. Sometimes that's what is needed, but a lot of times what is needed is a plan (no matter how vague) of where you want to go, and how you plan to get there. A To Do list is a basic type of a plan, and once you start organizing on any level, it tends to snowball until your whole project is encompassed by the plan. At least that's what should happen if you want to get things done. A **Big Plan** is made of many **Small Plans**. By following through on the small plans, you are following the big plan. I can't believe I let that wisdom escape me, its so fundamental!
