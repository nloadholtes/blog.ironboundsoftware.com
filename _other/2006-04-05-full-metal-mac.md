Imagine this: You had the resources to out and buy a really expensive, stylish, and cool car like a [Ferrari](http://www.ferrariworld.com/FWorld/fw/index.jsp). You get it home, show it off to your friends who are green with envy. Then you rip out the engine and replace it with a lawn mower engine. Guess what, its still looks like a Ferrari, but it will never run like a Ferrari. And that would be sad. That is how I feel about [Boot Camp](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/). Why would you buy a performance machine and then hobble it on purpose? Why not just but a cheap-o Windows machine? Why not cut the imaginary Windows umbilical cord and just use the Mac full time? And most importantly: When did I become such a Mac snob? I think the answer is the day I realized that life doesn't have to be complicated: you don't have to work for your computer, the computer can work for you. _This is my Mac. There are many like it, but this one is mine._
