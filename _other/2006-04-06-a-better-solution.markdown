Today after seeing the millionth headline about [Boot Camp](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/), I had a thought: "What if instead of rebooting you could just do a virtual session to do your Windows apps?" Apparently I'm not the only to think this. I read on [Gus' blog](http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2006/4/6.html#1456) that Parallels is releasing a [VM for the Intel-Macs](http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/). I think this is a great idea. It will allow potential converts to do their windows based work while staying in the Mac environment (i.e. not rebooting). I think that is a win-win situation for everyone (well, except Microsoft in the long run). My next thought was "Wow, it would be cool if this came integrated into OS X." Again, I wasn't the first one to [think this up](http://daringfireball.net/2006/04/windows_the_new_classic). In keeping with my car analogy in [yesterday's post](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2006/04/05/full-metal-mac/), I think an application like this would be the equivalent of hanging fuzzy dice from the rear view mirror. Goofy, but it can be removed quickly. ;)
