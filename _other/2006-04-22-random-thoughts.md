Its been a while since I posted anything, but rather than just give the usual "Oh, I'm so busy, I'll write more later" type of post, I thought I would just jot down some little things that I've given some thought to recently. 
* I recently put up my [200th post](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2006/04/01/time-and-distance/). I didn't realize that until the other day while I was looking at something else. I think that's kinda neat, because when I started this whole blogging thing, I thought it was a little bit goofy, kinda like [Doogie Howser](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096569/) writing in his computer journal. ([Was Doogie the first blogger?](http://www.kottke.org/05/03/bloggie-howser-md)??) Anyways, I'm impressed that I've been able to come up with 200 things to write about over the last two years or so.
  

* Speaking of the blog and all of the posts, the spammers have really been visiting me a lot lately. I've had to turn up the spam filters, so if you post something and you've never posted here before, it will have to be approved (by me) before it gets posted. If I was getting spammed for product that at least had something to do with the posts they were posted to, that would be one thing, but the volume and types of spam I've been seeing are just getting crazy!
  

* I might be doing a guest blog or two on a friend's blog in the coming week! That's pretty cool, so I'm going to have to thing up something really interesting to post there. More on that as the week rolls on.
  

* I am so glad the lab for the class I am taking this semester ends next week. I'm so tired of it.
  

* I'm reading the illustrated version of the Da Vinci Code, and I've got to say that it is so cool to read about some work of art or building and the look over at the next page and see a picture of it. It really brings the book to life. I'm not an art/architecture/France/Paris buff, so having the pictures there helps me visualize the story better. So far I'm liking the book, and I'm curious to see how the movie turns out.
  

* I'm also reading "Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality". There's a lot of good info in that book if you are interested in starting a one-man software shop.
  

* And finally, with the spikes in the price of oil these past few weeks it makes me laugh to see/hear people say that rising gas prices don't effect them because ( _Insert whatever reason here_ ). I guess those folks don't realize that the rising price also affects the cost of food (How is it delivered? - By gas powered vehicles. What is it wrapped in? -Plastics made from petroleum products.) and other things. My prediction is rising gas prices will cause the price of everything to rise. That's gonna suck. Hopefully this will convince people to change some habits (like driving enormous cars when a smaller more economical car will do just fine). Although it kills me to see [news reports](http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/04/19/good_fuel_misers/) claiming that Hybrid Cars aren't worth the extra cost. Yeah, I guess spending a little bit extra (especially since you're probably financing the car already) to make sure you use less gas and emit few emissions is asking a lot. But hey, don't forget to get the extra warranty, the spinners for your rims, the deluxe interior package, the satellite radio, the sun roof, **and** the leather seats. Because those features are important ya know. (In case anyone didn't pick up on it, that was sarcasm. It is much more important in my opinion to have a ecologically friendly vehicle that might save you from filling up your tank as often than it is to have a bunch of extras that are flashy but in the end don't do much.) 
And in the immortal words of [Forrest Gump](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/): " _That's all I have to say about that._ " Have a great day!
