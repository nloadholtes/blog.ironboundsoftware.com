I was invited to do a guest blog on [Hip Egg's Technical Analysis site](http://hipegg.blogspot.com/). Today I took him up on the offer and posted some thoughts about Technical Analysis. He's got some interesting ideas about stocks (basically using the graph of a company to predict its future). I threw my two cents in about how/why his approach has some merit. Basically I had an insight a while ago that in addition to the slope of a stock graph, the area under the curve can reveal some interesting information about the direction of the stock. I have no idea if there is any real basis for my idea, but in the sampling of stock graphs I've looked at, it seems there is a correlation. If nothing else, it does stir up a lot of conversation about the behavior of systems (and how they can be influenced by outside forces). Which reminds me, I need to finish up that news analysis program I was going on and on about a while back....
