The other day I posted about problem I was having while [refactoring some python code](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2006/05/26/pydev-note-about-refactoring/) while using the [Pydev](http://pydev.sourceforge.net/) plugin for Eclipse. [Fabio Zadrozny](http://pydev.blogspot.com/) (one of the developers for Pydev) saw my post and asked for some more details on my problem. After a few emails he had a work around for the issue. Thanks Fabio! The basic work around is to make sure that you have the "Auto-Refresh" option turned on. I never had that turned on so that's why I had the pyc files laying around even though the source files were moved. (The auto refresh option is located under window > preferences > general > workspace > refresh automatically.) Fabio also asked me to submit a bug and hopefully this issue will be resolved in the next release. This whole experience has been very cool. I found something, one of the developers noticed my posting, we talked through the problem, and a solution was found. All in the space of a day or so. That is just so cool, it is one of the benefits of open source software. A great piece of software with great support! Rock on Fabio and Pydev team!
