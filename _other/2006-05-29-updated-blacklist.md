Just as a note, I've gotten tired of the amount of spam I've been getting. In the arms race against spam I've been ratcheting up the security over the last few weeks. Right now I've got a "blacklist" of words that if they appear in a comment the comment will automatically be deleted (i.e. I will never see it). So, if you submit a comment, but never see it get posted that might be what happened. Also, to post a comment I have to approve your first posting (just to make sure you're not a bot) and from then on you should be able to post with no problems. Ahhh, the joys of modern times.
