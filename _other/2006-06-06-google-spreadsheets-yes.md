I've been grumbling for a while about the lack of spreadsheet choices for the Mac lately. Excel is really nice, but I don't want/need the whole office suite (plus its not a Universal Binary yet), Appleworks is a joke (and a bad one at that), OO is a system hog (and slow for me), and [Numsum](http://numsum.com) just isn't quite there. Just when I'm beginning to give serious thought to making my own spreadsheet program, Google releases [Google Spreadsheets](http://www.google.com/googlespreadsheets/tour1.html). I got my invite today and so far I'm liking it. I uploaded my Stargate episode list (to help me keep track of which ones I've seen, rating, etc.) and it is working pretty good for me. Only had to change one formula, which is impressive because it just uploaded that Excel file with no other problems.. The only bad thing so far is one spreadsheet I tried to upload just wouldn't load. But it is a rather large file (about 1.5 Megs of historical stock data on several worksheets).
