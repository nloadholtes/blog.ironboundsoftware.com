One thing that has bugged me about [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/) is that (at least compared to [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/)) there was no way to change your default search engine from Google. Or so I thought... It turns out if you do a search for SearchURLList.plist it will bring up the config file that allows you to enter in new engines. Just follow the format, and be sure to change the "PreferredSearchEngine" value to your preferred engine. Now I can hit [Ask.com](http://ask.com) straight from the search box!
