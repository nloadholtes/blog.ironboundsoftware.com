By now most of you have probably heard about AOL's accidental release of almost 2GB of search data. Its pretty interesting, this is a peek into the inner workings of a search engine, and more importantly into the search habits of people using the engine. I have a friend who uses search engines to look up websites. Literally. If you tell him to go to amazon.com, he will go to a search engine and type in "amazon.com" and then click on the link. I figured he was doing this because he knows it annoys the crap out of me, but now that I'm able to look into other people's search habits I see that a bunch of people do that. Just doing a cursory glance of the data (removing duplicate entries, then a simple count) reveals that there were over 2.4 million queries that started with "www" (out of 36 million queries in the data set). That blew my mind when I found out that these searches represented only something like 1.5% of the searches done at AOL. That means a lot of people like to type in the URL for a site! I never in a million years would have guessed doing that would be so popular... Anyways, lots of sites are popping up talking about this, check out [here](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/06/aol-proudly-releases-massive-amounts-of-user-search-data/). If you are interested in looking at the data, but don't want to wade in it, I saw on [Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/08/aol-data-first-web-interfaces-up/) that there's a site that offers a web interface to the data. Check out [AOL Search Database](http://www.aolsearchdatabase.com/). Of course the other side of this coin is the privacy issue. AOL did mask the user id of the people doing the search, but many people are claiming that it might be possible to identify individuals. This might be possible, some of the queries do seem to be about specific locations, and I guess it would be possible to link the location to actions taken by people. But in the grand scheme of things this is probably impractical for most people. However.... if this was "one piece of the puzzle" if it was viewed in a different light. Think of all the social network analysis that seems to be going on these days. This data combined with other sources (call records, bank records, etc.) could build a very interesting picture. [Jeff Jonas](http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/jeff_jonas/) talks about this in his blog a lot. Check out this [article](http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/jeff_jonas/2006/05/the_six_degrees.html) for example. Definitely something to think about.
