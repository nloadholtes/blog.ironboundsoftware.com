Awww yeah, here it comes! This Friday, [Stargate](http://gateworld.net) will celebrate its [200th](http://gateworld.net/news/2006/07/photogallery200.shtml) airing with a special episode. It looks like there will be a special code given out during the show so that the hard core fans can go on-line and see special behind-the-scenes footage. Also, last week's ratings were up for both SG-1 and Atlantis. Last week's episode on Atlantis was pretty cool, and this weeks looks interesting. [Richard Dean Anderson](http://www.rdanderson.com/) (aka [MacGyver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver)) will be guest starring in both SG-1 and Atlantis, so I'm sure that they will rock harder than usual. :) Anyways, tell your friends, tell your family, tell anyone who will listen: Stargate is gonna rock this Friday!
