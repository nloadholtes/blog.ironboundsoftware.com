I was in GMail today and I glanced up at the little ads that run along the top. You know, the one liners. Since those ads are based off of the content of your mail box, more often than not there's something up there I'm at least a little bit interested in. Tonight there was an ad that said: 

**Andrew Smith \- www.AndrewSmith.com \- Site of Andrew Smith. Nothing much to see here.**

WTF? I know people named "Andrew" and I probably have an email or two with the name "Smith" in it, but this is just odd. I clicked on the link to see what it was. It was a parked domain. With a note that said "this domain is NOT for sale". Other than that it just had search boxes and weather forecasts. My question is why would someone buy ads for a domain like this? I know adwords are cheap and all, but if your site isn't selling anything, and it isn't for sale, then why advertise it? Maybe this is some new Web 2.0 trend/business model...
