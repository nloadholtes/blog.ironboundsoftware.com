There's an old saying that 'you don't know what you've got until its gone'. The idea it is trying to convey is that sometimes we are experiencing something good constantly and we loose sight of the specialness of it. But when the good thing leaves we realize how much better we were when it was here. That's kind of the feeling I had when they announced the cancellation of [Stargate](http://scifi.com/stargate). I enjoy the show immensely, its just about the only thing on TV worth watching (other than The Office) and having it leave made me think that there would be a void. And to and extent that is true. [Stargate Atlantis](http://gateworld.net/atlantis/index.shtml) will still be there, and its actually been growing on me this season. Its true that some episodes of SG-1 have been rather... uhh... well, not really fan favorites. But ya know what? That's ok. You can't win every battle. In fact I think just the fact that we the fans had 10 years of SG-1 is great. The show has really raised the bar for what a sci-fi show can be. Hopefully it will inspire the next generation of shows to be as good (or dare I say, better?) as SG-1 is and was. Besides, thanks to DVD's and syndication I think SG-1 will be around for a looooong time. :)
