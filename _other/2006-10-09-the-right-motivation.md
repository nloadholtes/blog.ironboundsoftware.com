I saw on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/10/09/1344235) that someone has already beat the [Netflix](http://netflixprize.com) prize requirements! That didn't take too terribly long. I guess offering up the right prize (a cool million) can really get things going. :) But seriously, I think it was just opening up the contest to the world at large that is the thing that made this work. I'm hoping more companies will do similar things. Congrats to all! Now I wonder how much better people are going to keep on going...
