Why on earth would Google do this? [Techcrunch Â» Blog Archive Â» Google Has Acquired YouTube](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/09/google-has-acquired-youtube/) [Google Video](http://video.google.com/) seemed to be doing ok, [YouTube](http://youtube.com) just seemed to be a collection of random (sometimes pirated) videos. Why would google open themselves up to this potential landmine of litigation? Maybe the Internet Bubble is back... *sigh* And I was looking forward to a return to nice peaceful times when business plans had to make sense...
