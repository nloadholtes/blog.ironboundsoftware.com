[Everyone](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/10/google-docs-spreadsheets-launches/) is [talking](http://software.gigaom.com/2006/10/11/7056/) [about](http://blog.larixconsulting.com/blog/_archives/2006/10/11/2409228.html) the [Google](http://www.namedevelopment.com/blog/archives/2006/10/product_naming_anything_to_avoid_office.html) [office apps](http://www.technorati.com/tag/writely) [that](http://david.gizdecor.com/2006/10/11/docs-spreadsheets/) [were](http://bobchao.wordpress.com/2006/10/12/writely-spreadsheets/) [announced](http://www.sem-analytics.com/2006/10/googlegoffice_google_docs_spea.html?utm_source=atom&utm_medium=atom) [today](http://theinnerid.blogspot.com/2006/10/google-office.html). And while they are cool, I'm really kinda surprised that the new redesign of the [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/view/) has gotten so little press. I've been using the reader for a while now, and this new update to it is really great. My feeds were getting hard to manage (some feeds were updating often, others only once in a while) and the new format allows for fast and easy viewing, without letting good things slip by. Its still a beta product which shows sometimes when it reports new items that aren't there, but overall its pretty good. Google has a pretty good track record with these beta products, so if you are interested in an RSS news reader, head on over and check it out. And speaking of press, Google's [Code Search](http://google.com/codesearch) sure did make waves this week, and that really puzzles me. The site is a great resource for finding code, but most programmers I know usually are looking for an explanation about how something works in addition to a code sample. In fact, I was surprised Google launched this seeing how other sites like [Koders](http://koders.com/) seem to be doing a good job of covering this niche. But at least some folks out there have been having some fun with the search: [Which women do nerds prefer?](http://www.dancentury.com/home/2006/10/11/google-code-search-which-women-to-nerds-prefer/)
