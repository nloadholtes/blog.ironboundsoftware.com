Looking through the Netflix prize data, I saw something that made me do a double-take. Miss Congeniality seemed to be the most rated movie in the database. That struck me as odd, because I always imagined a movie like Lord Of The Rings would be the #1 most rated movie (since that the folks that I think Netflix is most popular with are into those movies). Today I saw this analysis on the Netflix forums: [Netflix Prize: Forum / Miss Congeniality](http://www.netflixprize.com/community/viewtopic.php?pid=800#p800). In this posting there is a breakdown of the movie ratings, and it explains a few things. Like the most loved or the most hated. Its a pretty interesting read (especially if you are feeling lazy and don't want to do the SQL, which is the category I fall into).
