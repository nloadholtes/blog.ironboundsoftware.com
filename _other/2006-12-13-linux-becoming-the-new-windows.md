My jaw hit the floor today when I read this: [OpenOffice gets pre-load, update notification ](http://news.com.com/2061-10795_3-6143359.html?part=rss&tag=2547-1_3-0-5&subj=news). I'm all for applications running/loading faster, but not pre-loading apps is one of the main things I like about about non-Windows operating systems. It looks like the [bloating](http://osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7324&page=2) of Linux continues, which is a shame. (Yes, there are distro's that are fighting this, but they don't get enough press like the big guys do.)

Repeat after me: small, light, tight.
