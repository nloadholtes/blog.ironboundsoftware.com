On Friday, the wife and I decided to stop by Blockbuster and pick up a movie. I had enough cash on me to cover the cost, but I decided to use my check card instead. After the 3rd time they had me swipe my card I thought that I should have just used the cash. The 5th time they asked me to swipe it I told them to swipe it. The guy behind the counter swore up and down that if the receipt didn't print I wouldn't get charged.... I should have known better. They charged me 3 times. *sigh* I thought in the future things were supposed to be getting easier. That will teach me to try and be all slick with my payment options. Now I get to play the fun game of "how many people do I need to convince that this is a mistake".
