If only [Philip K. Dick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick) was alive to see this. What happens when two chatbots start talking to each other? [Discover magazine](http://discovermagazine.com/2007/brain/i-chat-therefore-i-am/article_print) pointed an [ALICE](http://www.alicebot.org/) bot and a [Jabberwacky](http://www.jabberwacky.com/) bot at each other and got gems like this: 

> ALICE: Are you alive? Jabberwacky: Perhaps. A: Why the uncertain tone? J: Everything is uncertain except for five facts. A: The whole universe? J: And we both might just be some ones and zeros in the computer memory.

And this is my favorite exchange: 

> A: Do you think a machine will ever be considered â€œaliveâ€? J: Stranger things have happened. A: Not many people express themselves that way. J: How would you know, machine?
