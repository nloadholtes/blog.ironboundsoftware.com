So wide is the gap between talking and doing. Thinking is fun and all, but producing is what really matters. Sometimes fixing one bug can take forever to do. This is where I'm stuck at the moment. Its a lot like when you take forever to write one line of code (i.e. because you can't figure out what you need to do next). Productivity crashes, then your morale sinks like a rock. Soon it seems like everything is moving in slow motion, even the things that have nothing to do with the original stumbling block. Constant talk about things, especially when there is no action taking place, has the same effect on me. Tomorrow is a new day and I'm gonna have to try and do something to keep this malaise from taking root. In the words of Yoda: "Do or do not. There is no try." Action, not words.
