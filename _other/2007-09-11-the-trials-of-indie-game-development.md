I saw today that a indie developed "Fallout inspired" [RPG was being taken down by the author](http://www.rampantgames.com/blog/2007/09/indie-rpgs-just-not-worth-it.html) due to lack of sales. This bummed me out because: 

  1. It sounds like a game I would have really been interested in
  2. Although it had been out for some time, I had never heard of it
  3. I'm wanting to make a RPG that isn't based in a dungeon
  4. The world needs new games that aren't just derivative sequels of the same-old-same-old

Its always sad when a [product is retired](http://www.ausgamedev.com/index.html), but this situation sounds bad. According to the comments on the Ramapant Coyote site, lot of people are feeling the same way I do. But at the end of the day, its the author's call, and in this case the author decided to pack it in. I stated in #4 above that the world is too full of games that aren't anything special. That's why indie games are so exciting. Many are of the games that are made on the indie seen are passion works on the part of their creators. As a result these games are different than what you normally find in a store. They try new things, they take chances. But sadly, just as in real life, sometimes you win, sometimes you loose. I hope Mr. Moffat finds the success he is looking for in his future endeavors.
