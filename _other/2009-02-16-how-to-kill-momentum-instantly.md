  1. Get the itch to finish a stale project
  2. Carve out some time to work on stale project
  3. Upgrade your software stack to make sure you are current*
  4. Spend hours figuring out something simple isn't working
  5. Curse, debug, repeat
  6. Curse more when you realize that step 3 was where the train went off the rails

Yes, I made the mistake to upgrading the Google App Engine Launcher only to discover that for some reason it doesn't play nice with the Django Helper project (or apparently the latest version of Django). *sigh* I know, I can go and continue development without those tools, but I was really looking forward to playing with the AppEngine (using a Django project). Some days you are the pigeon, some days you are the statue.
