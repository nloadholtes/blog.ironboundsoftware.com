About two years ago I finally decided I was tired of my scratched up glasses and that I would get Lasik eye surgery. I was talking about this with some friends recently and thought I should do a post to talk about how things are now that I'm a few years away from it. I did a lot of research on Lasik before my operation, and a lot of what I found talked about the procedure itself and the immediate time after. I thought I would write this blog post and talk about how things are a while after the surgery. In short: Pretty good! As a computer programmer I'm rather attached to my eye sight. I was concerned that staring at screens all day might be in for a rough ride because you will have "dry eyes" after the surgery. Some days were tough, but using the preservative-free eye drops (like the doctor suggests) really helped with this. For me the dry eye problem went away pretty quickly, I would say within a month or two I was only having to put the drops in a few times a week as opposed to a few times a day. The doctors said my eyes were in good shape and it really showed in the recovery phase. The only thing that seems to heal slowly for me was my night vision. Loss of night vision is a common side effect of Lasik. My night vision has gotten better since the surgery, but it took almost a year, and it still doesn't feel quite the same as it did pre-surgery. The flip side of this is that in low-light conditions, I feel like I can make out some details a little bit sharper than I could before. I know that sounds odd, but it seems like as long as there's some good like like a quarter-moon or so, I feel like I can see better than I could with my glasses in that same condition. So, all in all I'm pretty happy with the way things turned out. Some people do suffer from negative side effects for longer or more intensely than others, but I think that as long as you follow your doctors instructions: 

  * Moisturize (your doctor will tell you how, usually with preservative free eye drops)
  * Don't rub your eyes! :)
  * Use the medicines and cremes as directed by the doctor.
  * Take your vitamins, eat your Wheaties, and get lots of rest.

So that is pretty much my follow up report. I'm glad I did it and I encourage others to talk to their eye doctor if they are thinking about it. I had my surgery at [LasikPlus](http://lasikplus.com/) here in Atlanta Ga., and the staff was great and very helpful. Check them out if you are thinking about it!
