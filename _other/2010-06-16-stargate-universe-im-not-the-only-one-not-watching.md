I'm a huge fan of SG-1. I own all 10 seasons on DVD. Even the last one, which *really* wasn't the greatest. When Stargate Universe was announced I was skeptical. I wasn't big on Stargate Atlantis, but I decided that the new series deserved a fair shake. So I watched the first half of the season. It went from "Not bad" to "Ehhh" to "*sigh*" to "Why bother" pretty quickly for me. Since it was taking a 4 month break between the first and second half combined with me not really caring about the major characters, I never watched the second half. Today on [the most excellent Stargate site, Gateworld.net](http://www.gateworld.net/news/2010/06/sgus-season-one-ratings-report/), they released some ratings numbers. It looks like I wasn't alone in my decision to tune out. Check out this nifty plot I made of the ratings over time: ![](https://spreadsheets.google.com/oimg?key=0AnYsR527TmLRdE9vTjNtQk1fNXdudG9qSE1zYUZFY1E&oid=1&zx=leguu09yg78s) *sigh*.....
