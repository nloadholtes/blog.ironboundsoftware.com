I started using [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) as my web browser a few months ago. Firefox has been good to me, but Chrome has that hunger to take over the browser market so I figured I would give it a spin. Especially since there are now good extensions for important things like flash blockers. But my one major gripe has been the seeming lack of RSS support in Chrome. In Firefox, Safari, and almost every other browser out today if you visit a page that has an RSS feed for it, you will see a little RSS icon (usually in the address bar). Clicking on it will take you to your preferred RSS reader where you can add in that feed. However in Chrome, there did not seem to be any native support for doing this. It turns out its an extension you have to install. Once you install the [RSS Subscription Extension](https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx?response=redirect&x=id%3Dnlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd%26uc%26lang%3Den-US) you will get that RSS icon in the address bar and be able to subscribe to the feed for that site.
