I've always heard curses was a pain to program, but I've got to say so far I'm digging it. I'm using the python curses, so maybe that is part of the reason why it is going so easily. (Doesn't python make everything easier?) 

## Curses and python

Anyway, if you are gonna do any curses programming be sure to check out [This awesome](http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/curses/) tutorial. Its everything you need to get your curses app up and going. Oh, and if you are wondering, yes, there are good reasons for writing something in curses. Its really useful for having a slick looking interface on your program. That coupled with its ability to run everywhere (no big downloads) is why programs like Borland's IDE's (think Turbo C/C++/Pascal/etc) were able to stay strong for so long.
