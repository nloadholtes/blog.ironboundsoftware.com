Last night I finished up the slidepuzzle. It ain't the prettiest code in the world, but it works and now it will tell you if you have won the game. The link for it is [here](http://www.geocities.com/nloadholtes/code/slidepuzzle.py.html).   
  
    
As a side note, last night while trying to debug it, I finally broke down and used IDLE to do a little bit of editing and to run the program. I have to say, it really made me think: I need to either get my usual editor (XEmacs) properly configured, or I need to get a python IDE. I'm thinking I might go get a python IDE since I've been saying for years that I need to configure XEmacs... ;)
