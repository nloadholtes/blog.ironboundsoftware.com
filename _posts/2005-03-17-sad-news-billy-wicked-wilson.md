A few weeks ago I wondered that Billy Wilson was up to. I used to read VoodooExtreme every day way back when and he always cracked me up. His pimp-talk was classic and always gave me some new phrase to use. I still use the phrase "nyquil-vodka smoothie" from time to time.  
  
    
And Billy also started doing interviews with developers which were always a hoot. Especially with folks like [Brian Hook](http://bookofhook.com) who kinda became a regular on the site. I learned a lot and was always, *always* entertained by these posts.  
  
    
But eventually problems cropped up on the website and Billy left. After that the site was never the same. Billy started a new site [GamingGroove](http://gaminggroove.com), but it took a long time to take off, so I didn't look at it for a long time. It kinda dropped off my radar, which is sad, I think the world can always use a laugh in the form of some good old fashioned pimp talk.  
  
    
Sadly, Billy passed away on Monday March 14, 2005. I'm seriously bummed out by this, the internet is now a little less fun without him here. R.I.P. Billy.
