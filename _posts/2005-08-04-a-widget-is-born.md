I'm proud to announce that I have created a [widget](http://wdb.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/) for the [OS X](http://wdb.apple.com/macosx/) Dashboard!   
  
Its called [PasswordMaker](http://ironboundsoftware.com/downloads/PasswordMaker.zip) and it is designed to help you create reasonably secure passwords that are easier to remember. For example, when making a new password, people will usually pick something that they can remember like the name of their dog. The problem is that if your dog's name is "Maddie" then there is a chance that a hacker could guess that word. Then the password is no good!  
[  
PasswordMaker](http://ironboundsoftware.com/downloads/PasswordMaker.zip) takes your word and "mangles" it so that it looks like the old word, but isn't. Take the name "Maddie". If you feed that into [ PasswordMaker](http://ironboundsoftware.com/downloads/PasswordMaker.zip) it would produce "M8dDI3" or "M8ddIE" or even "MADdEYE3". These suggestions make better passwords because they contain numbers, mixed case, and even special characters.   
  
[PasswordMaker](http://ironboundsoftware.com/downloads/PasswordMaker.zip) is setup to be random, so you can feed in a word and hit the "Make a password" button several times until you get a combination that you like (i.e. one that you are sure you'll be able to memorize).  
  
Best of all, the widget is free! Can't beat that price with a stick. So swing by my [website](http://ironboundsoftware.com/) and [download it today ](http://ironboundsoftware.com/downloads/PasswordMaker.zip)!
