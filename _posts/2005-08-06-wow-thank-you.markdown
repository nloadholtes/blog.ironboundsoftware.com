I submitted my [PasswordMaker Dashboard Widget](http://ironboundsoftware.com) to Apple earlier this week. Well after seeing the explosion of traffic to my [site](http://ironboundsoftware.com) it looks like it has been posted! Check it out [here!](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/calculate_convert/passwordmaker.html)   
  
This is really, really cool. I thought maybe one or two people would download it eventually, but to see this landslide of people coming to get it has really inspired me. Time to get to work on the next one!
