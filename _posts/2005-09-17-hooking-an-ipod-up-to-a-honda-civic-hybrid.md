I've been meaning to write about this for a while (I guess it never made it to my "To Do" list), a few months ago I installed a [USASpec iPod Interface](http://www.discountcarstereo.com/detail.aspx?ID=717) into my [Honda Civic Hybrid](http://automobiles.honda.com/models/model_overview.asp?ModelName=Civic+Hybrid). It is a neat little device that allows me to hook the iPod into the stock radio in the car, and control the iPod from the radio buttons (specifically, using the 6 disc changer buttons). I followed the directions I found on this [site](http://www.rightclick.com.au/brad/ipodmycar.html) and they worked perfectly. In fact, with the pictures that Brad has of the installation he did on his car, this site is better than the instructions I found from Honda on the web. The only thing I did different was to pop the radio (and most of the center cluster) out of the dashboard in order to hook up the CD cable. The other bit of advice I would offer is to make sure that you have the cables securely plugged in before you put everything back together. I didn't double check everything and the first time I fired it up, only the left side speakers were getting a signal. Additionally, instead of using the self-tapping screws that come with the interface module, I used zip ties to secure it to a metal crossbar that is behind the exterior panel that has the cigarette lighter on it.
