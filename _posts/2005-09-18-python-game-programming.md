Its been a while since I've touched my python game code. This [article](http://harkal.sylphis3d.com/2005/08/10/multithreaded-game-scripting-with-stackless-python/) about programming a game engine with [Stackless Python](http://www.stackless.com/) looks _really_ interesting. I'm gonna have to give this article a nice long read. Maybe it will inspire me to un-ass myself and do some python coding (which I miss doing, python is so much fun and very productive).
