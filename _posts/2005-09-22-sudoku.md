The other day my wife was telling me about the sudoku puzzle that they like to do in her office ([USAToday](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2005/09/21/why-we-are-not-always-motivated/) is where they get them). I had played with some of these puzzles a year or two ago, so I was anxious to try one out, because they are pretty fun. Today I was going over to the [MAA](http://maa.org/news/columns.html) website and saw there is a nice column about about Sudoku! Check it out:[Sudoku Variations](http://maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_09_05_05.html). It talks more about the history and variations of the game than it does about the math aspects of it, but it is still a good read.
