Have you ever learned something, but then not been able to use that knowledge for a while, then realized that you have forgotten it? That has happened to me recently. In the past week or two I've had to try and remember how to do some pretty basic stuff in perl and python, both of which I have not touched in months. It took me a while, but fortunately I eventually remembered enough to get going. Soon I am going to need to start a project in python so that I can regain my skills....
