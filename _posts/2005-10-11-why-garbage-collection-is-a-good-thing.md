[IBM's developerWorks](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks) site is always bringing something awesome to the table. This week there's an article talking about Java performance (and the myths). Go check it out! [Java theory and practice: Urban performance legends, revisited](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp09275.html?ca=dgr-lnxw01JavaUrbanLegends) My biggest reason for liking the garbage collector in Java is because it frees the programmer from having to worry so much about memory allocation/deallocation. And if you want to read between the lines on that last sentence I'm saying "It help prevent a whole lot of memory leak related errors". Also check out [jwz's thoughts](http://www.jwz.org/doc/gc.html) on garbage collection, he hits a lot of really great points.
