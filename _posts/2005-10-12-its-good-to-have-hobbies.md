I saw this article about the next "tourist" who is scheduled to visit the international space station. Apparently he wants to do something a little different: [Japanese whiz aims for space -- in cartoon uniform](http://www.spacedaily.com/2005/051011085159.1rxihabe.html) As dorky as it might sound right now, that might look pretty cool when they are doing their walk to the launch pad. Two cosmonauts and a guy gressed up like a Gundam pilot. Of course it would be even cooler if he could actually dress up like the Gundam itself...
