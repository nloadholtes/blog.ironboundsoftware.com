I was thinking of doing an article about Sudoko and my strategy for solving them, but a quick check on the [MAA.org](http://maa.org/news/columns.html) website lead me to an [article](http://www.sciencenewsforkids.org/pages/puzzlezone/muse/muse1005.asp) which eventually lead me to [Sudoku.com](http://www.sudoku.com/) where there are several pages of strategy. I read through them quickly and for the most part that site does what I do to solve them, but it explains it in a weird way (at least that's what I thought). Maybe this will inspire me to do my own "how to win" page. **UPDATE** : I made a page that help you solve sudoku puzzles by giving you hints. Check it out: [Sudoku Helper](http://ironboundsoftware.com/products/SudokuHelper/)
