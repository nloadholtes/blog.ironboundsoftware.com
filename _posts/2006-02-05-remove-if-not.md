I'm trying to be a better person by wrapping my brain around the Lisp programming language. I've got to say, **remove-if** and **remove-if-not** are two of the most confusing function names I have ever come across. I'm sure with time and experince I'll change my view, but as a quasi-Lisp-newbie my mind warps when I read those function names in sample code.
