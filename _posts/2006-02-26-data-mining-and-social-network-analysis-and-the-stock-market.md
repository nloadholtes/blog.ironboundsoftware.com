There's a lot of hoopla and hype in the news these days about Data Mining and Social Network Analysis. Both of these topics are interesting to me, so I've been doing a lot of reading as of late. Some of the links I've found that I really like are [Introduction to Social Network Methods](http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/) which is a nice text and a good introduction to SNA, and these two links about [charting office connections](http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/feb2006/id20060216_633293.htm) and its [importance](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_09/b3973083.htm). If you are interested in more links, be sure to check out [my del.icio.us bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/nloadholtes). Also, be sure to poke around in del.icio.us, there's a ton of info in that system. On a somewhat related note, my boss has started a blog. In a past life he was a stock broker so he started up a site called [Hip Egg](http://hipegg.blogspot.com/) where he does technical analysis of various companies stocks by looking at their graphs. He has some fascinating ideas and it has stirred up a lot of talk in our office about stocks and data analysis in general. In fact, the discussion has inspired me to pull out my copy of [Spidering Hacks](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/spiderhks/) and start looking at what information is out there for various companies. My idea is that I can whip up some python programs to go out there on the internet and gather a ton of data that will either support or refute his predictions about a stock. The reason I think this would be interesting to do is because he bases his predictions almost solely on the shape of the company's graph; I feel that looking at the numbers behind a company (cash on hand, news reports, product launches, etc.) will give you a more accurate prediction. That and it will just be fun to tie together several topics like data mining, data analysis, graph/network math and theory, web crawling, and python as they apply to the stock market.
