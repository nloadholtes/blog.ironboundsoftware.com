Do you like Sudoku? If so, check out my [Sudoku Helper](http://ironboundsoftware.com/products/SudokuHelper/)! I wrote it to help you solve Sudoku puzzles by just giving you a hint of what the numbers could be, instead of just telling you the answer. This way you can still enjoy the game! It works by having you enter in the numbers in the column and row that intersect at the square you are stuck on. Additionally you can enter in the numbers that are filled in for that 3x3 square. The [Sudoku Helper](http://ironboundsoftware.com/products/SudokuHelper/) will then tell you what numbers could be in the square. Give it a try! Sometimes the best strategy is to get a hint, not the final answer. Hopefully you'll find this helpful! [Sudoku Helper](http://ironboundsoftware.com/products/SudokuHelper/)
