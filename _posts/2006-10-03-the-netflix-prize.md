[Everyone](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/02/movietally-netflixs-missing-features/) is talking about the offer put up by [Netflix ](http://netflixprize.com/)yesterday. Basically if you can improve their movie recommendations, you win a million big ones. This is a really cool idea. Its a hard problem (otherwise everyone and their brother would already have done it), that looks like it has no solution. But just because it looks hard doesn't mean there isn't a solution! To help out [Netflix ](http://www.netflix.com/Default)has supplied a data set of user recommendations. Looks like its time to fire up [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org), break out the [python](http://python.org), and put on my Data Miner hat, and start reading those AI books. ;)
