Once you fight your way through all of the junk (photo's, [xkcd](http://xkcd.com) comics, etc.) on [reddit](http://reddit.com), you'll occasionally find some pretty interesting and enlightening things. A few days ago I saw this link to a [Scheme interpreter in Python](http://thinkpython.blogspot.com/2005/02/simple-scheme-interpreter.html). I've always been interested in the Lisp family of languages, and this is one of them implemented in python. What a cool learning experience. After looking at that for a while I tried googling for some other examples and found this really awesome [Lisp in Python](http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/py4fun/lisp/lisp.html) implementation. Every so often I'll think to myself "Wow, how hard can it be to make a language?" Then I'll remember that it can be pretty damn hard (actually I remember my Programming Languages Concepts class, then I get the shakes thinking about all of the edge cases and other complications that you have to keep track of). Seeing something like these links is really educational for me, I get to see how two similar languages have been implemented (and thanks to the comments on [programming.reddit.com](http://programming.reddit.com/)) and how they could have been done differently.
