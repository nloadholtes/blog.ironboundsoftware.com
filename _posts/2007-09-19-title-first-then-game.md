I've been watching [Code Monkeys](http://g4tv.com/codemonkeys/) a lot lately. If you haven't seen it yet, its a cartoon on [G4](http://g4tv.com) that is basically South Park, but set in a 80's video game company. Its pretty funny, sometimes sick, but always twisted. Every week the characters get into all kinds of trouble, usually while trying to make a "new" game. One of the best parts of the show is when the developers are either talking about or pitching their new games. Just from hearing the titles of the games I wish some of them had been made! Cool titles like "Monkey vs. Cobra" or "Hobo Killer" or "Family Ties: The Video Game". Plus some of the shots of the games looked pretty funny too. Check out the whole list here: [Games featured on Code Monkeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_featured_on_Code_Monkeys) All of those wacky titles reminded me of all the times in other movies, TV shows, games, etc. I saw a "fake" video game and thought it was the coolest idea ever. Like "Billy Graham's Bible Blaster" on the Simpsons. Or "Astro Chicken" in the [Space Quest](http://www.spacequest.net/sq3/) series. Classics! And thanks to the wonders of the internet/web2.0/lazy web/wikipedia, there's a massive list of all of these fictional games! Check out the list here: [Fake Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_electronic_games) Seeing all of those games there got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if someone made some of these games based on just the title? (Or in the case of shows like the Simpsons, take the clip of the game and expand it into a full fledged game!)Â  That would be so cool. So cool in fact, I think I'm going to start doing that, looking at a title and then trying to come up with a game. Cheesy, yes. Wacky, you bet. Fun? Lets find out.
