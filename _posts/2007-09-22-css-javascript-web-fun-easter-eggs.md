It occurred to me the yesterday, with more and more people seeing the power of Javascript and CSS, more websites are getting slick. Ok, that's a pretty obvious statement, but here's something that's not obvious: This presents a great opportunity for easter eggs! [Easter Eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_\(virtual\)) are little hidden things in side of a bigger program. Some times it just the developer's names, other times it can be something totally unexpected like a flight simulator hidden in a spreadsheet program. With the power of Javascript and nice tutorials like this [one](http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/java_anim2/index.html), there's a lot of opportunity to have some real fun! Just think, with all of the computing power a modern browser affords us developers, it should be very easy to recreate tons of games from the Atari 2600, early Nintendo systems. The imagination can very easily run wild....
