One of those "personal/professional" development things that you should do every so often is try to learn something new in your field. For me, I've decided I will learn more about Lisp, and programs in general. To that end I've been working my way through the book [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) which is a dense volume that is chock full of good knowledge about how computer programs work from a critical and analytical point of view. The language the book uses is Scheme which is a variant of Lisp. Having worked with [XEmacs](http://xemacs.org) and its version of lisp (called appropriately elisp), I thought I would be able to pick up Scheme pretty quickly. This is pretty much true, since the two languages have the same general syntax/form. One thing I don't have those is a Scheme interpreter! I did install SBCL and CLISP a while ago, so I figured that I would just use that. Well, it turns out that Scheme is also slightly different than Common Lisp. :) But thanks to Peter Seibel and his excellent book "Practical Common Lisp", I was able to translate the first few programs in the SICP so that they would run in my CLISP-Slime environment. So if you find yourself in this situation, be sure to check out the best [Common Lisp tutorial](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) on the net. Its free and it is very well written, so I highly recommend it. I remember playing around with it a while ago, and being impressed with it back then. The good news is it is still as good now as it was then.
