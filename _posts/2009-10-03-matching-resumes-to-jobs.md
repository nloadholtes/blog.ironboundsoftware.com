Have you ever looked at a job posting and tried to figure out if you are a good match for that job? I've written a Google App Engine application to try and help people figure that out. Paste in a copy of your resume and a copy of the job description, and it will try and figure out how well of a match you would be for that job. Check it out: <http://app.ironboundsoftware.com> I'm really impressed with the Google App Engine environment (go Python!) and had fun writing this. Hopefully this will help people out in their job hunt. Times are tough, and hopefully this little application will help someone get into the perfect job for them. Try it out and let me know what you think!
