This is really awesome: [A mercurial plugin that allows you to interact with git repositories](http://hg-git.github.com/) It has apparently been around for a while, here's a blog post [explaining how to use hg-git](http://github.com/blog/439-hg-git-mercurial-plugin) I see lots of stuff going on with git, there's a lot of projects using it and github is a hotbed of activity. It has some really neat tools like gist, and all of the visualizations of the project stats and I think that is a large part of its appeal. As a mercurial user the closest site we have is bitbucket which is nice, but lacks some of those features. This hg-git bridge finally pushed me to sign up for a github account. I honestly don't know why I didn't get one before, if nothing else it is a great thing to have because of the gist feature. I have some ideas for some small python projects, maybe I'll give [my github account](http://github.com/nloadholtes) a test drive with one of those. I'm sure I'll stay with [my bitbucket repositories](http://bitbucket.org/nloadholtes) for a while, but it is nice to know that there are options out there. Especially from CVS which I have come to dread working with again. Svn really doesn't bother me that bad, but the flexibility of DVCS systems like hg and git are beginning to spoil me...
