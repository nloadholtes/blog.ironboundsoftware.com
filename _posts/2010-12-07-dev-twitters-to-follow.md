In an earlier post, I talk about how [twitter is becoming the new "plan file"](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2010/08/18/are-tweets-the-new-plan/). Since that post, [I've joined twitter](http://twitter.com/nloadholtes), and I try to use it as a plan file for my own development activities. 140 characters isn't a lot of space, so in a way I think it is more honest: you have to get to your point pretty quickly. Which isn't to say that you can't goof off with it... But of course, I'm not the best or most interesting developer on twitter. Here's a lit of developers I'm follow because they post really interesting stuff: 

  * [John Carmack](http://twitter.com/#!/ID_AA_Carmack) \- id Software, creator of Doom, Quake, and lots of other awesome stuff
  * [Ryan C. Gordon (icculus)](http://twitter.com/#!/icculus) \- Awesome dude, ports a lot of games to linux
  * [Ted Dziuba](http://twitter.com/#!/dozba) \- He's got opinions, and he isn't shy about sharing them
  * [Zed Shaw](http://twitter.com/#!/zedshaw) \- An old-school hacker, he's always up to something interesting

There's a ton more out there, go and check it out!
