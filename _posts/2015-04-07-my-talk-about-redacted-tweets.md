Last month I gave a presentation about my [Redacted Tweets](https://github.com/nloadholtes/Redacted-Tweets) project at my local python users group, [PyAtl](http://pyatl.org). Originally it was supposed to be a lighting talk, but I stretched it out to a full talk because one of the scheduled presenters couldn't make it. Thankfully it is an entertaining story and everyone seemed to really enjoy my presentation. [Here are the slides that I presented](https://github.com/pyatl/talks/blob/master/2015-03/redacted-tweets/redacted_twitter_nick_loadholtes.pdf). It was a lot of fun to tell everyone about this goofy little project. If you have any projects like this laying around, I would encourage you to present them at your local meetups! It is fun to share what you work on, especially if it is something funny that can make people laugh.
