I have written some [posts about resources](http://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2016/01/26/resources-building-software-development-skills/) you can use to improve your development skills. There's tons of great resources out there, but I haven't told you the secret to making them work. Without this key bit, everything I'v presented is absolutely useless. Beyond worthless. 

## Are you the key master?

The key to making all of the knowledge in the world useful is one thing: applying it. That's right, if you do not actually apply the knowledge you have acquired, you have wasted your time.Â  _Don't get me started on the value of time and why wasting it is the worst thing you can do._ Putting knowledge into action forces you to actually learn something. Anyone can read a book about programming, but can anyone actually build a website? **The doing is what turns knowledge into a skill.** Simply knowing will not take you very far in your career (or life for that matter). 

## Building skills with your knowledge

The first thing that I hear people say when I bring this up in conversations is, "But I don't know what to build!". To that I answer "Build anything". For me, I usually have a few notes laying around of things that would be cool to have. For example, a service that will send you a text if there is going to be bad weather on a certain spot on your way home. That example is so vague it could encompass a lot of different things when it comes to development. Normally in a business this is a very bad thing. But for a personal project, this is great! Now you have a million things you could do, and most of them are great candidates for applying your new knowledge. For me, I recently started a course in [modern front end design techniques](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/learning-path/intro-modern-front-end-web.do). Its a nice little course, but how do I make sure I'm actually learning and not just watching videos? I decided to take the lessons and apply them to re-doing my personal website. This worked out well, I was able to give the site a technical facelift and apply some of the lessons I learned. The end result is I now have something sitting in a repository that can show how I took a django static website and turned it into a gulp/javascript static website. 

## GO FORTH AND DO.

So to wrap up: **doing > knowing**. Go out there and show the world that you know something by doing something.
