I'm super happy to announce that my first book, "Developer Interviews: How to land your dream job on your terms" has been released on Amazon! Check it out:[ https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FLIDC8C](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FLIDC8C) [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="386"][![Developer Interviews cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kEElcFdGL._SX384_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FLIDC8C) Developer Interviews: How to land your dream job on your terms[/caption] In this book I give my tips on how software developers can interview better when it comes to the dreaded job hunt. Some of the things I talk about include: 

  * What companies are looking for
  * What YOU should be looking for in a company
  * Warning signs that a company might be a bad fit for you
  * Why technical recruiters can be a great help
  * What to do if you make a mistake during the interview

The book is available for a very programmer friendly price of $1.28, or if you are a member of Amazon Prime you can borrow it for free on your Kindle! Also, if you are subscribed to Kindle Unlimited, this book can be yours for free! I would really appreciate it if you check the book out and leave me a a rating and review on it. Writing this took what seemed like forever, but it was a great exercise. I think I'm going to do a blog post about when "developers write books". Its a great step in my entrepreneurial journey. But first, why did I write this book? 

## The motivation for Developer Interviews

Too often I feel that interviews "just happen" or are otherwise taken for granted. Especially by those who aren't as intimidated by the whole process. Additionally I've observed that while an interview might seem to go great, or the company might really want you to join them, there are warning signs that you should look out for. If you see one of those, then that might not be the job for you! So if you are looking for advice on what you can do better when interviewing, please check this book out!
