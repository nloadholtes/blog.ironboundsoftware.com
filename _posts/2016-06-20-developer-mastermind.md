Recently I have been describing myself as "A developer interested in entrepreneurship". And lately I've been hearing a lot about masterminds. Inspired by a few podcasts, I threw together an MVP to see if I could find other like minded people who would be interested in a developer mastermind. Lets dive into this fun little experiment! 

## Finding my tribe

In his book "Think and Grow rich" Napoleon Hill introduces the concept of a mastermind. A mastermind is basically a group of like minded people who meet to discuss their progress and to hold each other accountable. For me, a developer mastermind sounds like a great idea: I can talk with people who share a common vocabulary, but are striving for something bigger and better. There seems to be a lot of entrepreneurs on twitter. Since I'm a huge fan of twitter ([are you following me on twitter yet?](https://twitter.com/nloadholtes)) I headed over to ads.twitter.com and set up a card. The card pointed to a survey I setup on Google Forms. The intent of the ad was to discover if the people clicking on the survey were interested in forming a developer mastermind. E.g. People just like me. The total cost for this experiment was.... $0! When I signed up on Twitter ads, they gave me a $50 credit and I was able to run the experiment for a few days and only used up $30 of that credit. The form/survey was free also, and so was my MailChimp account. I used MailChimp to send out an email to the people who filled out the survey (the last question was "If you want to learn more, leave your email address"). 

## A developer mastermind: The results

I let the campaign run for a week. By the end 4 people to filled out the survey! I looked at the survey results and then sent out this email:

>   Hi, I'm Nick and a few days ago I put up a survey on Twitter about Masterminds.  
> 
> When you filled out that survey you made a statement. You are saying "Hey, I'm serious and want to make things better for my business!" That is awesome. I feel the same way which is why I made that survey.

> As a thank you for having the courage to fill out the survey I wanted to send you some mastermind resources that I've found very useful.
> 
> **Books**
> 
> You can't really talk about masterminds with out bringing up "Think and grow rich" by Napoleon Hill. He seems to be the first person to really propose a mastermind as a means of "checks and balances" when running a business. The book is a classic and if you would like to check it out, [it is available on archive.org](https://archive.org/details/ThinkAndGrowRichNapoleonHill). To read only the part on Masterminds, jump to chapter 10!

> **Podcasts**
> 
> I'm a big fan of podcasts, I find they are a great way to learn new things on my commute. Here's a couple mastermind related ones that I have found to be both informative and inspirational. Quick note: all of the folks on these podcasts seem to be bootstrapped which is really interesting.

>   * [Entreprogrammers](http://entreprogrammers.com/) \-- This is a really awesome podcast of 4 software developers-turned-entrepreneurs. Each week they record their mastermind hangout/call and post it as a video and an audio podcast. It is really interesting to hear them hash out their ideas and strategies.
>   * [Startups for the rest of us](http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/) \-- This podcast is hosted by Rob Walling (of getdrip.com) and Mike Taber (of singlefounder.com) talk about their week-to-week activities and also will typically have a little presentation for the listener about a certain topic.
>   * [Zero To Scale](http://zerotoscale.com/podcast-episodes-archive/) \-- Hosted by Greg Hickman and Justin McGill, this podcast also features a mix of business reports and strategies mixed with interviews and lessons.
> 

> 
> **Websites**
> 
> Everyone says "join a mastermind", but where do you go to find like minded people? They can be hard to find at times! Here's a few websites that I've seen come up time and time again.
> 
>   * [Mastermind Jam](https://mastermindjam.com/) \-- I've heard a few interviews where entrepreneurs have mentioned they used this site to find their mastermind. Basically it is a service where you pay $45 (if you are in the I'm-just-getting-started phase of your endeavor) and then they match you with a similar group.
>   * [Founder Cafe](https://www.foundercafe.com/) \-- This is a service run by Rob and Mike (from the Startups for the rest of us podcast) that is also a paid match making service. It seems to be more exclusive, the price is a little bit higher ($99 per quarter) and your application is reviewed before you are allowed in.
>   * [Zero to scale](http://zerotoscale.com/fb) \-- The podcast also offers a private Facebook group. This is probably less of a mastermind site and more of a "meet similarly minded people" site.
>   * [Fizzle](https://fizzle.co/) \-- This service seems to be an all-in-one solution that offers training and accountability. It seems like more than just a mastermind group, but I thought I'd include it.
>   * [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/) \-- I have found there are a fair number of "local" groups that are entrepreneurial in nature, but in this day and age of the internet, why limit yourself to people in your local area?

## So what happened?

Sadly, no one responded to my email. I learned a lot and that's ok. I learned how to run a small ad campaign, how to look at a survey, and that while a mastermind for developers is a great idea, to form one I would need to take a different approach. Copy writing is a serious skill. More people would have filled out the survey if I was better at it, I am confident that of that. In fact, If I had a developer mastermind, that would definitely be something I reported back to them. ;) 

## Next time:

Be sure to let me know if you would like to learn more about this experiment! I'd be happy to share some more knowledge about this experiment, leave a comment or ping me on twitter! (I'm[ @nloadholtes](https://twitter.com/nloadholtes)) I still think a developer mastermind is a great idea, if you agree, let me know!
