And now thanks to reading a few great books I understand that I can easily do experiments on the world around me to learn where I can push the boundaries to learn new things! Framing these things as experiments is a powerful mind hack: If an experiment fails, that's ok! It was just an experiment. Keep that in mind the next time you find yourself pausing before trying something new or scary. Let's take a look at what I've been up to! 

## Successful experiments

  * [Stoic Emails](http://eepurl.com/b5zwSL) \-- Every weekday I send out stoic quotes to an email list. It is a small list, but I am learning everyday
  * [Redacted Tweets](https://twitter.com/redactedtweet) \-- This twitter bot that I wrote is a source of great amusement to many people. That makes me very happy.
  * [Nose Randomize](https://github.com/nloadholtes/nose-randomize) \-- Ok, this was not an experiment per-se, but I did go out on a limb and do a lot of new things. This my biggest open source project. It was being pip installed a few hundred times a month at one point.



## Less-than-successful experiments

Of course, with the good comes the "bad". These were failures, but only in the sense that I'm not driving a Ferrari now. :) Each of these were a learning experience, and I'm glad I did them. 

  * [Developer Mastermind](https://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2016/06/20/developer-mastermind/) \-- As a part of my resolve to take action faster, I put together an ad campaign and a survey in an attempt to form a Developer oriented Mastermind. 4 people did give me their email addresses, but my pitch was not very compelling. No one wanted to move forward with the mastermind.
  * [Rate my resume](http://ratemyresume.ironboundsoftware.com/) \-- I set very high expectations for myself with this project. And that is the only reason I'm listing it as a "less-than-successful" experiment. From scratch I designed and created a tool to help job hunters find the perfect job. Ambitious? Absolutely. Perfect? Not even close. Educational? In every way possible.



## Experiments I'm still trying to figure out

Sometimes I'll have something that isn't a success but also isn't a failure. Maybe it changes over time, sometimes something completely unexpected pops up. Here's a selection of things that have me scratching my head. 

  * [Developer Interviews](https://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2016/05/23/announcing-developer-interviews/) \-- This is a small ebook that I wrote about to help developers with interviews. The book isn't intended to be a replacement for some other books out there (particularly the ones about interviewing puzzles), but rather as a soft-skills approach to interviewing that so many developers seem to be missing. It hasn't exactly sold a million copies, but I think that might be because my marketing of it was pretty weak.
  * Setting and tracking goals -- Every week I sit down and review my week and try to determine if I'm getting closer to my goals. I have evolved the way I do this over the last few months, and I have achieved several goals. But... I keep feeling I could be doing this differently/better. Overall I think this is a success, but I also think this time next year I'll be doing it very differently than I am now.
  * Anything to do with sales -- Sales are how businesses make money. I obviously need to do more work on this one. :)
  * Starting a business -- Stay tuned on this one, there's more coming. ;)



## The future!

More experiments to come! The only true failure in my mind is to quit. Even with failures, I still learn lots and have lots of fun. So I predict that my experiments in the future will be more ambitious, and the source of many more blog posts.
