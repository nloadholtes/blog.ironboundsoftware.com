This past weekend was Thanksgiving here in the US. This is a time of year where we try to reflect on the things we are grateful for. Well, at least that's what we are supposed to do. Some folks tend to use it as an excuse for excess... But I digress. I've been on quite the adventure the last year so I thought this would be a good time to take stock and see where I've been. So given that here's some things I'm grateful for. 

## Opportunities

This is a great time to be alive. There are so many things available to most people (especially here in the U.S.) and all that you have to do is reach out and take them. I've always known this, but have I always taken advantage of it? Perhaps not. This year I worked harder to take advantage of things that came my way. Truthfully its pretty amazing what things are around you most of the time. Opportunities to learn, opportunities to earn, opportunities to just be involved. Going forward I'm resolved to say yes to more things. 

## Community

There's an old saying that "no man is an island". Being involved in communities is a wonderful thing. Finding your tribe is one of the greatest things you can accomplish. Be it a programming community (Python is great!) a neighborhood group, or a mastermind (I'll have a lot more to say about that in the near future!), finding a group can make a world of difference to your outlook. I've found a few communities this year and I feel it has helped me grow in a lot of different way. I'm very grateful for finally realizing that having a group (or several) is a great thing to have. 

## Family

Family is where its at. Big or small, blood or not, having a support system you can always count on is so important. Find or make one. You need it. I'm grateful for mine. 

## Consistency

This year I began to explore the true meaning of consistency. Publishing this blog every week has been part of that consistency. Thank you for reading and helping me keep this consistent habit. :) I've also been working to consistently reflect on things at the end of the week, or more frequently in some cases. This simple practice is very powerful, it is "forcing" me to be aware of things. Part of this reflection is thinking about things I'm grateful for. 

## Conclusion

This has been a pretty hectic year, but one that I'm very thankful for. What are you thankful for?
