Lately I've been spending a lot more time reading. There's a ton of ideas out there, along with a bunch of garbage. (Translation: Don't read the news kids) Here's some things I've read and found interesting. These are things that have been catching my interest lately, including the IndieWeb movement, thinking, tools, and just being awesome. 

## IRC

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a really old technology. Think of slack, but without emoji and gifs. But in that simplicity lies some great power. I recently [ranted about my new fav tool Glowing Bear](https://ironboundsoftware.com/blog/2019/06/22/recent-tools-ive-discovered/), and I keep finding that the tools and ethos around IRC jive really well with what I want out of networked computing. Here's some things I've read along those lines: 

  * [Why I Live in IRC](https://aaronparecki.com/2015/08/29/8/why-i-live-in-irc) \- This is kind of the direction I'm moving now... I've got several slacks integrated into my IRC program. Home Automation projects chatting over IRC is next!
  * [What Really IRCs Me: Mastodon](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/what-really-ircs-me-mastodon) \- An example of getting disparate services into one place with IRC

Also, as a side note (and related to the section below), Mastodon is really interesting. I'm expecting that it will continue to gain popularity as sites like Twitter continue to struggle with their... issues. 

## IndieWeb related

For years I've wondered about giving our thoughts to other's platform. If I think of something and type it up, I put it here on my blog. If I put it on medium.com or Facebook, then they could take it down at any time. I like the idea of owning my words, and the IndieWeb movement really appeals to me. I am working towards implementing more of the tools they are putting out. 

  * [Together](https://grant.codes/2019/07/08/together) \- This is a new tool that looks like a great way to tie together several sites into one unified view. I'm becoming more aware of the time I spend on-line, and this looks like a great way to get it consolidated into one spot.
  * [An IndieWeb reader: My new home on the internet](https://aaronparecki.com/2018/04/20/46/indieweb-reader-my-new-home-on-the-internet) \- An older post that talks about the predecessors of the first link
  * [Into the Personal-Website-Verse](https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse) \- A great read about how the internet should be (vs how it is)
  * [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) \- The clearinghouse for more information on this movement



## Just awesome ideas

Here's just some links of things I've run across that just have me star struck. 

  * [NEW APPROACH COULD SINK FLOATING POINT COMPUTATION](https://www.nextplatform.com/2019/07/08/new-approach-could-sink-floating-point-computation/) \- A new way to handle numbers in a computer? Very interesting challenger to the established IEEE standards we all are relying on today.
  * [Reilly's Hardcore Year](https://rchase.com/) \- Great story unfolding of a guy who is just going for it and building a business in public
  * [Scott H. Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/articles/) \- Scott is just an all around interesting guy. Check out that link to see all the things he is up to (ultralearning, memory, just being the best you that you can be)
  * [Notion](https://notion.so) \- This newish tool is a great competitor to Evernote... It combines a lot of great ideas into one spot in a pretty well put together package. Plus it let me use Markdown to edit things!



## Wrapping up

One more quick link: I've been working on reading more lately and after seeing a cool site by [Harper](https://twitter.com/harper) I was inspired to make my own page to show off what I've been tracking on Good Reads. Here's my [Reading List](http://reading.ironboundsoftware.com). What cool things should I be reading? Leave a comment or hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nloadholtes)!
