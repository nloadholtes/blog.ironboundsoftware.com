This is something new I'm trying: a journal recapping the work I'm doing on [Remote Matcher](https://remotematcher.com) which is my current side project. My goal with this is to do some public accountability so I'll > keep moving forward on this project.

> _(Real talk: I'm passionate about the idea behind the project, but I seem to have some kind of mental block about getting work done on it. These blog posts are meant to apply pressure to me to report my progress publicly and move the project forward)_

# BLUF
_(Bottom Line Up Front)_
Got shit done this week!

# Last week(s) in review
Let's look at the goals from last week and score them

1. Plan for 12-week year. (This is a must!) -- Done
2. Stemming of Bi-grams complete with tests. -- Done
3. 20 new tweets -- **FINALLY** got this one done. 

Score: 3/3 = **100%**

This week I also made it a point to [post my progress on MakerLog](https://getmakerlog.com/@nloadholtes). If you are interested you can see what I'm up to on a daily basis. I also made a spreadsheet track and plan all of these activities for the next few weeks.

# Technical issues
Got the stemmer in place and deployed the new code for tokenizing things to the dev testing environment.

It has been baking for a few days, so it is time to check and see what's up. This whole effort is to improve the quality of the job posts that are sent out, so if this isn't 100%, then it won't see production.

At the moment I don't have good metrics around what constituents high quality, so this will be a bit of a touch-and-feel situation. That will improve over time with a few more items on my technical todo list.

# Growing the business
So doing the OKR's is a good move. I've got some guardrails up to make sure I stay on track, and I'm using the 12 week year methodology to help keep my productivity up. Which gets my motivation up. Virtuous cycle. 

I hope.

## More users
Got over 20 new tweets down! This one dragged on for a while, so I don't want to celebrate it too hard.

I do want to re-visit and tweak some of the existing tweets, so that will be an activity for an upcoming week. For now, I will sit on the new tweets and deploy them once things on the technical side pick up steam (or the experiment peters out).

## More money
The next major step is to get the sponsored posts into the emails. There's a lot of little things that have to happen to get that going, so those will be happening over the next week or so. Once that is done, then it is back to the posting page, and the copy writing that needs to happen there.

For the look and feel of the sponsored posts, again there's a lot of fuzzy "I'll know it when I see it" instead of hard scientific numbers. I actually have an action item to determine how to measure this work.

# Next steps
1. Sponsored post work
2. Measuring engagement for all of this work
3. 20 new tweets *and* start some content posts
