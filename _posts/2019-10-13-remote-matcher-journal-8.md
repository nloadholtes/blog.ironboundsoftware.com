This is something new I'm trying: a journal recapping the work I'm doing on [Remote Matcher](https://remotematcher.com) which is my current side project. My goal with this is to do some public accountability so I'll > keep moving forward on this project. 

> _(Real talk: I'm passionate about the idea behind the project, but I seem to have some kind of mental block about getting work done on it. These blog posts are meant to apply pressure to me to report my progress publicly and move the project forward)_

# BLUF
_(Bottom Line Up Front)_
Taking the work from the last few weeks and finally rolling it into prod!

# Last week(s) in review
Let's look at the goals from last week and score them

1. Logic around the sponsored job posts -- Done
2. UI work on the job posting page -- Not started
3. Deploy code to prod -- Done
4. Migration script for existing users -- Started/Done (still needs to be tested and run)

Score: 3/4 = **75%**

Over all an easy week in terms of development. Was nice to see the new code run in prod with zero disruption to existing users.

# Technical issues
Next steps are going to involve UI changes. Not my favorite task topic, but one that is necessary.

# Growing the business

## More users
Three new signups this week! (Only one left)

Its getting close to the time to start deploying the new tweet and getting more activity on getting users on-board. Once that is rolling it will be time to start pitching people to submit jobs.

## More money
Its really gratifying to see the test results: I can make a submission, see the fake charges go through, and then see the submission show up in the emails.

I think now its just a matter of getting a submission in there and testing out how people respond to it.

# Next steps
1. 20 new tweets
2. Getting the posting page reworked (field layout, etc.)
3. Working on the Copywriting (sales page, front signup page)
