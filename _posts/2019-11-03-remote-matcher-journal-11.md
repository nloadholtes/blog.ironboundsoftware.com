This is something new I'm trying: a journal recapping the work I'm doing on [Remote Matcher](https://remotematcher.com) which is my current side project. My goal with this is to do some public accountability so I'll > keep moving forward on this project. 

> _(Real talk: I'm passionate about the idea behind the project, but I seem to have some kind of mental block about getting work done on it. These blog posts are meant to apply pressure to me to report my progress publicly and move the project forward)_

# BLUF
_(Bottom Line Up Front)_
This week was a definite low point. Not much of anything done.

# Last week(s) in review
Let's look at the goals from last week and score them

1. Continue with work to replace the typeform stuff on the front page. -- Done
2. Get sales page done -- Nope.

Score: 1/2 = **50%**

Life intruded this week and less than ever got accomplished. Not an excuse, just the facts. The good news is that the Typeform stuff has been removed from the front page. 

# Technical issues
Typeform removal turned out to be pretty easy. The page now loads faster, but it doesn't look as cool as it used to. But now I don't have to worry about things like people blocking the Typeform widget, or it running really slow for some reason.

I did launch a placeholder domain for content so I can start growing that sweet sweet SEO juice. 2 articles have been started, but not proof-read or launched.

Additionally I have a bee in my bonnet to get the sales page launched. Lots of cleanup needs to happen there, but I think I might just add the content (the why and how of buying a job posting) and launch without restyling it like I want. At least then it will be out there.

# Growing the business

## More users
Last week there were a few signups, but this week there were none. There were 2 people who unsubscribed, one of whom filled out the exit survey and said it was because they got a job! (I don't know if they found the job through me or another way).

The twitter account has gotten a few new followers this week, I'd have to look at the stats to see if that is significant compared to past weeks. Maybe the new tweets are doing some magic?

## More money
What I said last week, sums up what I think this week:
> I think I'm close to just launching everything and letting the site accept orders.
> 
> I probably should just do it and get it over with.

# Next steps
1. Add to the sales page to get it in "MVP-shape" for launching
2. Publish content to the new subdomain
