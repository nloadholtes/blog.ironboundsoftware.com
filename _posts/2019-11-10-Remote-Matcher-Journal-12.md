This is something new I'm trying: a journal recapping the work I'm doing on [Remote Matcher](https://remotematcher.com) which is my current side project. My goal with this is to do some public accountability so I'll > keep moving forward on this project. 

> _(Real talk: I'm passionate about the idea behind the project, but I seem to have some kind of mental block about getting work done on it. These blog posts are meant to apply pressure to me to report my progress publicly and move the project forward)_

# BLUF
_(Bottom Line Up Front)_
This week... ugh. This is getting sad. Nothing accomplished.

# Last week(s) in review
Let's look at the goals from last week and score them

1. Add to the sales page to get it in "MVP-shape" for launching
2. Publish content to the new subdomain


Score: 0/2 = **0%**

This week... I just have no words. 

I think I was busy with some family stuff. There was some work stuff too. But nothing accomplished? Ugh.

Looking back I think I have hit a wall: there's things to be done, but my plans are sooo... non-existent. There was a fire when I started this that seems to have gone out. 

As a side note, I had a similar situation happen at work: I ran out of tasks for a project and then I was rudderless for a few days.

I probably need to recognize these situations sooner and do "emergency" maintenance to get myself on track.

# Technical issues
A new subdomain was created and some posts for it were started... but that's about it.


# Growing the business

## More users
Had an unsub, and in the exit poll they said the jobs were not very useful for them.

That hurts. I haven't checked their account settings vs. the jobs to see what was going on yet.

## More money
The deadline is approaching and things haven't changed much from when I started. I'm in shape to collect job postings, but it isn't live yet. 

# Next steps
1. Get a plan in place to finish the rest of this 12 week year experiment strong. Literally this is the only thing I need to accomplish this week.
