summary: Taking note of taking notes
---

Over the last few years I've been working more on taking notes. Between work and home, we are inundated with tons of information. Not all of it is important enough to be remembered, but the pieces that should be are usually critical. I've spent some time investing in keeping track of my knowledge and I thought I would share some notes on this.

## Why take notes?
The older you get, the more you see. And the more you see, the pickier you get about what you want to remember. So, especially at work, write it down. There's almost no way to be sure in the moment what will be important down the road. If its recorded somewhere then you can search for it in the future. 

As an example, a co-worker needed to know an ID that we had used in a test run... 14 months ago. No one I know memorizes hex numbers, so this is a prime usecase of looking it up in the knowledge base.

## Core values
So with that in mind, I have some core values I want to respect with my technology choices.

1. Open, future proof format -- Plain text is about as open and future proof as possible, so this made sense. Markdown is my preferred markup language and even with its variations I think that in 20 years it will still be able to fulfill #2 and #3.
2. Easily searchable -- Plain text can be manually read through, grep-ed through, or loaded into one of a million different search engines quite easily and with minimal translation.
3. Portable data -- The programs I use to take the notes are secondary to the notes themselves. Therefore, the

* **roam** - A big mindset shift combined with the need for connectivity made it hard for me to use this one. I know some people really like it, and there are some really great ideas in there that are leaking into other apps, but this just isn't for me. *
