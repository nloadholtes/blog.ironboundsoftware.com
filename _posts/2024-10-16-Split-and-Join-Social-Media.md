# Split and Join Social Media

For a long time I've followed the idea of [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) where you basically post your content on your own site, and then "syndicate" it out to everywhere. In practice this meant posting to my Pleroma instance and then having [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) copy that post over to my twitter/X account.

For the most part that has worked well. But now I've got a new project (more on that in a later post) and it makes more sense for me to post more directly on twitter.

So I've decided to shut down the bridge between the two worlds.

Why? Although I aim to be "the same person everywhere", the project is going to be more oriented towards the folks on twitter. So it doesn't make sense to just throw it out to everyone and hope that everyone likes it (because they won't).

Instead I am going to make sure to focus my efforts on twitter to ensure that I'm doing the best job I can with my messaging and replies.

Sometimes you just need to make sure your efforts are pulling in the right direction and this is one those times for me. A unified presence on the web is nice, but for now I've got to split things up a little bit and let them grow.
