summary: Just do it
---
Lately I've been seeing the phrase "You can just do things" being thrown around on line. Usually this is a snarky response to someone complaining about *waves hands* whatever.

I am trying hard not to succumb to snark anymore, but I can't help but really like this phrase. It is true. We live in a time where there are more opportunities available to us than our ancestors could have imagined.

Should we sit around bemoaning all the things because there's someone that just doesn't fit with our world view?

Or should we take action?

A lot of people default to the easy path. Action is hard. Requires effort. Work.

I think about the Dark Ages in Europe from time to time. Progress basically stopped for many years, each generation lived pretty much the same life as those that came before them.

But what if there was more action during that time? Where would we as a species be now?

Take action.

You can just do things.
