Software developer, space fanatic, and aspiring entrepreneur. 

If I had to describe myself and interesting 3 phrases, I would probably choose those. Hi, I'm Nick and you have found my blog.

On this blog I'm keeping a public record of things I've tried, things I'm interested in (see the first sentance), and tidbits that I think might be helpful to others.

By day I'm a software developer who works primarily in Python, and at night I sleep (hahahaha).

I've been described as "really helpful", a "programmer with a personality", and as "the guy who left 1 chip in the bag". I've built a few things over the years, and I'm currently thinking about the next thing I could spend hours fretting about.

If you'd like to get in touch, please feel free to email at `nick @ ironboundsoftware.com`

I am currently experimenting with Digital Minimalism so I'm not on social media as much any more. I did used to [tweet](https://twitter.com/nloadholtes), and I might go full on with mastodon soon.
